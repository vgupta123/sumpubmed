unfortunately, the task of implementing an efficient ghmm-based gene finder is already a nontrivial one, and it can be expected that this task will only grow more onerous as our models increase in complexity.
as a first step toward addressing the implementation challenges of these next-generation systems, we describe in detail two software architectures for ghmm-based gene finders, one comprising the common array-based approach, and the other a highly optimized algorithm which requires significantly less memory while achieving virtually identical speed.
we finish with a brief illustration of the impact these optimizations have had on the feasibility of our new homology-based gene finder, twain.
in describing a number of optimizations for ghmm-based gene finders and making available two complete open-source software systems embodying these methods, it is our hope that others will be more enabled to explore promising extensions to the ghmm framework, thereby improving the state-of-the-art in gene prediction techniques.
we then show how both of these architectures can be accelerated by a factor of two by optimizing their content sensors.
the generalized hidden markov model  has proven a useful framework for the task of computational gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes, due to its flexibility and probabilistic underpinnings.
