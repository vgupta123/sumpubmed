this transcription factor is therefore likely to play an important role in modulating the responsiveness of tissues to cgrp.
to date, little is known about the molecular mechanism that activate/inhibit ramp- <dig> gene expression.
receptor activity modifying protein- <dig>  is a single transmembrane-domain protein required for the functional expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide  receptors.
to initiate studies on the transcriptional regulation of the mouse ramp- <dig> gene, ramp- <dig> transcriptional initiation sites were mapped in a variety of tissues.
these findings suggest that tissue specificity of ramp- <dig> gene expression is mediated by a negative acting transcription factor that represses ramp- <dig> gene expression in non-ramp- <dig> expressing tissues.
