dapfinder and dapview are novel brb-arraytools plug-ins to construct gene coexpression networks and identify significant differences in pairwise gene-gene coexpression between two phenotypes.
each significant difference in gene-gene association represents a differentially associated pair .
network results are easily displayed in cytoscape.
our tools include several choices of filtering methods, gene-gene association metrics, statistical testing methods and multiple comparison adjustments.
