phylogenetic analysis of the aurochs mtdna genome supports the conclusions from previous studies of short mtdna fragments - namely that italian aurochsen were genetically very similar to modern cattle breeds, but highly divergent from the north-central european aurochsen.
bos primigenius, the aurochs, is the wild ancestor of modern cattle breeds and was formerly widespread across eurasia and northern africa.
complete mitochondrial genome sequences are now available for several modern cattle and two pre-neolithic mtdna genomes from very different geographic areas.
these data suggest that previously identified sub-groups within the widespread modern cattle mitochondrial t clade are polyphyletic, and they support the hypothesis that modern european breeds have multiple geographic origins.
after a progressive decline, the species became extinct in  <dig>  the origin of modern taurine breeds in europe is debated.
in this study, we applied a combined strategy employing both multiplex pcr amplifications and  <dig> pyrosequencing technology to sequence the complete mitochondrial genome of an  <dig> -year-old aurochs specimen from central italy.
here we present the analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome of a pre-neolithic italian aurochs.
