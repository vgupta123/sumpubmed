of the  <dig> low level inhr,  <dig>  had a -15c → t mutation in the inha promoter region, and  <dig>  a -32g → a mutation in the ahpc promoter region.
from april  <dig> and march  <dig>   <dig> smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were enrolled and all positive cultures were tested for drug susceptibility.
<dig> of the  <dig> ethambutol resistant  isolates displayed a mutation in embb gene.
all of the  <dig> rifampicin resistant  isolates carried mutations in the rpob gene , his526asp , and asp516val ).
however, prior to implementation in a given setting, the association of specific mutations with specific drug resistance phenotypes should be evaluated.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate molecular markers in predicting drug resistance in the central region of cameroon.
this study provided the first molecular investigation assessing the correlation of phenotypic to genotypic characteristics on mtb isolates from the central region of cameroon using dna sequencing.
the potential of genetic testing to rapidly diagnose drug resistance has lead to the development of new diagnostic assays.
a total of  <dig> drug resistant and  <dig> drug sensitive mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates were screened for genetic mutations in katg, inha, ahpc, rpob, rpsl, rrs, gidb and embcab loci using dna sequencing.
