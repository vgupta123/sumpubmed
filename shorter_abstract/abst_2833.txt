eradication regimens for h. pylori infection have some side effects, compliance problems, relapses, and antibiotic resistance.
polyphenols from almond skins were effective in vitro against h. pylori, irrespective of genotype status and could therefore be used in combination with antibiotics as a novel strategy for antibiotic resistance.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of natural almond skins before and after simulated human digestion and the pure flavonoid compounds epicatechin, naringenin and protocatechuic acid against h. pylori.
h. pylori strains were isolated from gastric biopsy samples following standard microbiology procedures.
susceptibility studies on  <dig> strains of h. pylori, including two reference strains , were performed by the standard agar dilution method.
we have previously shown that polyphenols from almond skins are active against a range of food-borne pathogens.
amongst the pure flavonoid compounds, protocatechuic acid showed the greatest activity  against h. pylori strains.
therefore, the need for alternative therapies for h. pylori infections is of special interest.
natural almond skin was the most effective compound against h. pylori , followed by natural skin post gastric digestion , and natural almond skin post gastric plus duodenal digestion .
helicobacter pylori is known to be a gastric pathogen of humans.
