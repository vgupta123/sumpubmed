these two methods were tested by characterizing transcriptome content using sequence alignment to previously characterized reference proteomes and by identifying pfam domains.
instances of gene copies exhibiting topological patterns that correspond to shared phenotypes were observed in several gene families including floral development and timing genes.
both the concatenated analysis and those of  <dig>  separate gene trees supported monophyly among the woody bamboos, which is incongruent with previous phylogenetic studies using plastid markers.
alignments and phylogenetic trees were generated for  <dig>  genes and for all genes in a concatenated analysis.
transcripts were identified using phylogenetic methods and categorized as a, b, c, d or e-class genes, which control floral development, or soc or svp-like genes, which control the timing of flowering events.
putative nuclear orthologues were also identified in bamboos to use as phylogenetic markers.
because of the striking differences in floral morphology and phenology between the herbaceous and woody bamboo lineages, mads-box genes, transcription factors that control floral development and timing, were characterized and analyzed in this study.
next-generation sequencing now allows for total rna extracts to be sequenced in non-model organisms such as bamboos, an economically and ecologically important group of grasses.
transcriptomes were assembled using both reference-based and de novo methods.
bamboos are divided into three lineages, two of which are woody perennials with bisexual flowers, which undergo gregarious monocarpy.
