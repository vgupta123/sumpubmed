serogroup b meningococcal  isolates currently account for approximately 90% of invasive meningococcal disease  in greece with st- <dig> clonal complex predominating.
the potential of a multicomponent meningococcal b vaccine  recently licensed in europe was investigated in order to find whether the aforementioned vaccine will cover the menb strains circulating in greece.
4cmenb has the potential to protect against a significant proportion of greek invasive menb strains.
vaccine components were typed by sequencing for factor h-binding protein , neisserial heparin binding antigen  and neisseria adhesin a .
their expression was explored by meningococcal antigen typing system .
