thus, it is important to find drugable target genes for nsclc to develop an effective therapy for nsclc.
we selected eleven critical genes that may mediate metastasis using recently proposed principal component analysis based unsupervised feature extraction.
we identified eleven potentially critical genes that may mediate nsclc metastasis using bioinformatic analysis of publically available data sets.
about 85% to 90% of lung cancers are nsclc and the 5-year survival rate is at best still below 50%.
non-small cell lung cancer  remains lethal despite the development of numerous drug therapy technologies.

integrated analysis of publically available gene expression and promoter methylation patterns of two highly aggressive nsclc cell lines generated by in vivo selection was performed.
among the eleven genes, tinagl <dig> and b3galnt <dig> are possible candidates for drug compounds that inhibit their gene expression.
