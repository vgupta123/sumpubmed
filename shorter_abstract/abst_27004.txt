in this study, quantitative trait locus  and expression qtl analyses were applied to identify genetic factors that are relevant to seed oil traits in jatropha.
the qtls and eqtls, especially qc18:1- <dig>  qoilc- <dig> and qoleiii- <dig> with contribution rates  higher than 10%, controlling oleic acid, total oil content and oleosin gene expression respectively, will provide indispensable data for initiating molecular breeding to improve seed oil traits in jatropha, the key crop for biodiesel production.
high oleic acid and total oil content are desirable for jatropha breeding.
among the significant qtl controlling total oil content, qoilc- <dig> was mapped on lg <dig> a relatively high significant level with lod  <dig>  and pve  <dig> %.
the major fatty acids in seed oil of jatropha, a biofuel crop, are palmitic acid , stearic acid , oleic acid  and linoleic acid .
olei and oleiii were mapped on lg <dig>  closing to qtls controlling oleic acid and stearic acid.
the eqtl of oleiii, qoleiii- <dig>  was detected on lg <dig> with pve  <dig> % and overlapped with qtls controlling stearic acid and oleic acid, implying a cis- or trans-element for the oleiii affecting fatty acid compositions.
until now, little was known about the genetic bases of these oil traits in jatropha.
meanwhile, oleosins are the major composition in oil body affecting oil traits; we therefore developed snp markers in three oleosin genes olei, oleii and oleiii, which were mapped onto the linkage map.
interestingly, the qtl qc18:1- <dig> overlapped with qc18:2- <dig>  controlling oleic acid and linoleic acid compositions.
we identified  <dig> qtls underlying the oil traits and  <dig> eqtls of the oleosin acid genes.
composite interval mapping identified  <dig> qtl underlying the oil traits.
