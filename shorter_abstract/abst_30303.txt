in nonlinear dynamic systems, synchrony through oscillation and frequency modulation is a general control strategy to coordinate multiple modules in response to external signals.
increasing evidence suggests that frequency modulation is also common in transcription regulation.
interestingly, many of the phase locked gene pairs exhibit higher order than 1: <dig> locking, and significant phase lags with respect to each other.
we show that it is efficient at identifying network modules of focused biological themes that are important to cell cycle regulation.
using the yeast cell cycle data, we show that significant phase locking exists between transcription factors and their targets, between gene pairs with prior evidence of physical or genetic interactions, and among cell cycle genes.
in addition, it can automatically address issues of arbitrary time lags or different dynamic time scales in different genes, without the need for alignment.
when compared with simple correlation we found that the phase locking metric can identify gene pairs that interact with each other more efficiently.
conversely, the synchrony information can be utilized to infer interaction.
in this study, we investigate the potential of phase locking analysis, a technique to study the synchrony patterns, in the transcription network modeling of time course gene expression data.
based on these findings we propose a new phase locking metric for network reconstruction using time course gene expression data.
