depending on the initial angle of stem lean, the apical response to the lateral light source differed.
significant changes were determined in the protein accumulation of  <dig> protein spots.
in control and 15째 inclined plants, the apex turned directly towards the light source after only  <dig> h. in plants inclined at 30째 and 45째, the apex first reoriented in the vertical plane after  <dig> h, then turned towards the light source after  <dig> h. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was then used to describe the molecular response of stem bending involved in photo- and gravi-tropism after  <dig> hr and  <dig> days of treatment.
the primary gravitropic response is concomitant with a modification of the proteome, consisting of an over accumulation of energy and metabolism associated proteins, which may allow the stem to reorient rapidly after bending.
we quantified the speed of maritime pine seedlings to reorient with regard to light and gravity over  <dig> days.
our study demonstrates a rapid gravitropic response in apices of maritime pine seedlings inclined >30째.
little or no response was observed at the stem bases of the same plants.
early response gravitropic associated proteins were identified, which are known to function in energy related and primary metabolism.
a group of thirty eight proteins were found to be involved in primary metabolism and energy related metabolic pathways.
seedlings were inclined at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> degrees with vertical plants as controls.
a lateral light source illuminated the plants and stem movement over time was recorded.
