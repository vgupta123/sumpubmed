our approach allows critical parameter identification and produces hierarchies of models.
critical parameter identification is an important issue in systems biology with potential applications to biological control and therapeutics.
the methods are demonstrated for simple examples and for a more complex model of nf-Îºb pathway.
second, for non-linear systems we develop an algorithm based on dominant solutions of quasi-stationarity equations.
cellular processes such as metabolism, decision making in development and differentiation, signalling, etc., can be modeled as large networks of biochemical reactions.
first, we consider linear kinetic models, which appear as "pseudo-monomolecular" subsystems of multiscale nonlinear reaction networks.
in all cases, we obtain robust simplifications and also identify the critical parameters of the model.
in these situations reduction to a common level of complexity is needed.
we propose a systematic treatment of model reduction of multiscale biochemical networks.
in systems biology we also need to compare models or to couple them as parts of larger models.
our approach also deals naturally with the presence of multiple time scales, which is a general property of systems biology models.
in order to understand the functioning of these systems, there is a strong need for general model reduction techniques allowing to simplify models without loosing their main properties.
for oscillating systems, quasi-stationarity and averaging are combined to eliminate time scales much faster and much slower than the period of the oscillations.
