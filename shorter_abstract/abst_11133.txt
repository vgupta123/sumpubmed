experimental validation results indicate that the be/bw heterodimeric transcriptional factor, encoded by the b-locus, could regulate s. scitamineum sexual mating and/or filamentous growth via modulating glucose metabolism and hog1-mediating oxidative response.
to further understand the function of b-mating locus, we carried out transcriptome analysis by comparing the transcripts of the mutant strain ssΔmat-1b, from which the ssbe <dig> and ssbw <dig> homeodomain transcription factors have previously been deleted, with those from the wild-type mat- <dig> strain.
s. scitamineum possesses a sexual mating system composed of two mating-type loci, a and b locus.
we previously identified and deleted the b locus in s. scitamineum, and found that the resultant ssΔmat-1b mutant was defective in mating and pathogenicity.
furthermore, go and kegg enrichment analysis suggested that carbon metabolism pathway and stress response mediated by hog <dig> mapk signaling pathway were altered in the non-mating sets.
