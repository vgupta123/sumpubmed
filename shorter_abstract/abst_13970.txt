four methods are used: two kinds of multifractal analysis performed on the numeric sequences obtained from the dinucleotide free energy, z curve analysis and global descriptor of the promoter/non-promoter primary sequences.
we attempt to recognize the human pol ii promoter sequences from the non-promoter sequences which are made up of exon and intron sequences.
using the global descriptor method ,  <dig> of the  <dig> experimentally verified promoter sequences of human chromosome  <dig> are correctly identified.
all the  <dig> possible combinations of the seven methods are tested.
computational prediction of eukaryotic pol ii promoter sequences is one of the most significant problems in sequence analysis.
existing promoter prediction methods are still far from being satisfactory.
the high accuracies achieved suggest that the methods of this paper are useful for understanding the difficult problem of promoter prediction.
they are used to generate certain spaces and then each promoter/non-promoter sequence is represented by a point in the corresponding space.
promoter region plays an important role in determining where the transcription of a particular gene should be initiated.
