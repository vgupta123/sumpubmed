alw i nicking enzyme and the mly i restriction enzyme.
alternatively, the hairpin structure could be removed by cleavage with the mly i restriction enzyme, thereby releasing the oligonucleotide sequence contained within the hairpin structure from the hairpin.
the hairpin comprises recognition sequences for a nicking enzyme and a restriction enzyme.
furthermore, the hairpin can be removed by cleavage with the mly i restriction enzyme.
chemically synthesized oligonucleotides with hairpin structures were acquired from our standard supplier.
we have named such hairpin structures "suicide cassettes".
we present here a method for the enzymatic production through dna amplification of oligonucleotides with freely designable 5'-ends and 3'-ends, using hairpin-containing self-templating oligonucleotides.
by running successive rounds of ligation, rolling circle dna synthesis, and nicking, the original oligonucleotide could be amplified as either the -strand or the -strand.
following ligation, tandem repeats of the complementary sequence of the circular oligonucleotide could be produced through rolling circle dna synthesis.
another problem with chemically synthesized oligonucleotides is that secondary structures contained within an oligonucleotide reduce the efficiency of hplc and/or page purification.
the oligonucleotides are amplified by successive rounds of ligation, rolling circle dna synthesis and nicking.
additionally, ligation of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides is less efficient than the ligation of enzymatically produced dna molecules.
