equus  shows three different patterns of dietary partitioning equus  neogeus from the province of buenos aires indicate a preference for c <dig> plants in the diet.
these results confirm that ancient feeding ecology cannot always be inferred from dental morphology.
stable isotope data demonstrate changes in c <dig> grass consumption, inter-species dietary partitioning and variation in isotopic niche breadth of mixed feeders with latitudinal gradient.
here, we use stable carbon and oxygen isotopes preserved in  <dig> fossil tooth and bone samples for seven species of horses from  <dig> different localities to document the magnitude of the dietary shifts of horses and ancient floral change during the plio-pleistocene.
while the carbon isotope composition of horses skeletal material decreased as latitude increased, we found evidence of boundary between a mixed c3/c <dig> diet signal and a pure c <dig> signal around 32° s and a change from a mixed diet signal to an exclusively c <dig> signal around 35°s.
we found that the horses living at high altitudes and at low to middle latitude still have a c <dig> component in their diet, except the specimens from  <dig> m, which have a pure c <dig> diet.
the change in altitudinal vegetation gradients during the pleistocene is one of several possibilities to explain the c <dig> dietary component in horses living at high altitudes.
equus  andium from ecuador and equus  insulatus from bolivia show a preference for to a diet of mixed c3-c <dig> plants, while equus  santaeelenae from la carolina  and brazil are mostly c <dig> feeders.
