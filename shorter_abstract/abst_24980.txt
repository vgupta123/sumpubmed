recently there has been an explosion of new data sources about genes, proteins, genetic variations, chemical compounds, diseases and drugs.
we have created a new semantic systems chemical biology resource, and have demonstrated its potential usefulness in specific examples of polypharmacology, multiple pathway inhibition and adverse drug reaction - pathway mapping.
we demonstrate the utility of chem2bio2rdf in investigating polypharmacology, identification of potential multiple pathway inhibitors, and the association of pathways with adverse drug reactions.
initiatives such as bio2rdf and lodd have tackled the problem of linking biological data and drug data respectively using rdf.
we have also demonstrated the usefulness of extending sparql with cheminformatics and bioinformatics functionality.
we have also created a linked-path generation tool to facilitate sparql query generation, and have created extended sparql functions to address specific chemical/biological search needs.
integration of these data sources and the identification of patterns that go across them is of critical interest.
