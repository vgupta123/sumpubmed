atlantic halibut  is a high-value, niche market species for cold-water marine aquaculture.
altogether our findings support the hypothesis that the atlantic halibut has an xx/xy sex determination system.
understanding the sex determination mechanism and developing sex-associated markers will shorten the time for the development of monosex female production, thus decreasing the costs of farming.
these should also help to speed up the inclusion of neomales derived from many families to maintain a larger effective population size and ensure long-term improvement through selective breeding.
a linkage map was constructed based on  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  markers and  <dig> microsatellites consisting of  <dig> linkage groups, which corresponds to the number of chromosome pairs in this species.
two of these groups  consisted of only females, while the other two  contained balanced sex ratios .
using a variety of machine-learning algorithms 97% correct classification could be obtained with the 3% of errors being phenotypic males predicted to be females.
assays for  <dig> snps with significant association with phenotypic sex were tested in both population data and in  <dig> additional families.
halibut juveniles were masculinised with  <dig> Î±-methyldihydrotestosterone  and grown to maturity.
