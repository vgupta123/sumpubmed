we also developed a simple, readily automated procedure to utilize training papers of similar data types from different bodies of literature such as c. elegans and d. melanogaster to identify papers with any of these data types for a single database.
this approach has great significance because for some data types, especially those of low occurrence, a single corpus often does not have enough training papers to achieve satisfactory performance.
we developed an automatic method for identifying papers containing these curation data types among a large pool of published scientific papers based on the machine learning method support vector machine .
this classification system is completely automatic and can be readily applied to diverse experimental data types.
we successfully tested the method on ten data types from wormbase, fifteen data types from flybase and three data types from mouse genomics informatics .
it is being used in the curation work flow at wormbase for automatic association of newly published papers with ten data types including rnai, antibody, phenotype, gene regulation, mutant allele sequence, gene expression, gene product interaction, overexpression phenotype, gene interaction, and gene structure correction.
our methods are applicable to a variety of data types with training set containing several hundreds to a few thousand documents.
during the biocuration process, a critical first step is to identify from all published literature the papers that contain results for a specific data type the curator is interested in annotating.
curation of information from bioscience literature into biological knowledge databases is a crucial way of capturing experimental information in a computable form.
