multi-tgdr local selected  <dig> metabolites with a 0% misclassification rate and a  <dig> % cv- <dig> error rate.
one important advantage of multi-tgdr local is that it allows inference for determining which feature is related specifically to the class/classes.
thus, we recommend multi-tgdr local be used because it has similar predictive performance and requires the same computing time as multi-tgdr global, but may provide class-specific inference.
we extended an existing feature selection algorithm, threshold gradient descent regularization , to handle multi-class classification of “omics” data, and proposed two such extensions referred to as multi-tgdr.

both multi-tgdr frameworks were used to analyze a metabolomics dataset that compares the metabolic profiles of hepatocellular carcinoma  infected with hepatitis b  or c virus  with that of cirrhosis induced by hbv/hcv infection; the goal was to improve early-stage diagnosis of hcc.
we applied two multi-tgdr frameworks to the hcc metabolomics data that determined tgdr thresholds either globally across classes, or locally for each class.
like other “omics” data, metabolomics data has the characteristics of a smaller sample size compared to the number of features evaluated.
multi-tgdr global model selected  <dig> metabolites with a 0% misclassification rate  and had a  <dig> % 5-fold cross-validation  predictive error rate.
