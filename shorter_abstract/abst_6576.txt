thus we considered the hematopoietic system and found that seven days after poly injection, the number of blood cells in peripheral blood decreased drastically.
investigation of bone marrow cells showed that these became apoptotic within seven days after poly injection.
committed myeloid progenitor cells and cells with long term reconstituting potential were lost from bone marrow within four days after poly injection.
furthermore, infusion of normal bone marrow cells rescued mice from death induced by loss of thoc5/fms interacting protein.
the transcription/export complex is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man and is required for coupled transcription elongation and nuclear export of mrnas.
furthermore, mechanistically depletion of thoc5/fms interacting protein causes the down-regulation of its direct interacting partner, thoc <dig> which may contribute to altered tho complex function and cell death.
tho complex  components are not essential for bulk poly + rna export in higher eukaryotes, but for the nuclear export of subset of mrnas, however, their exact role is still unclear.
thoc5/fms interacting protein is an essential element in the maintenance of hematopoiesis.
no pathological alterations, however, were observed in liver, kidney or heart.
