in this study, eleven co-evolving sites have been detected via different molecules, which may be more important than others.
at the same time, species own two psba  copies hardly have positive selection signals among the d <dig> protein coding sequences.
collectively, our results indicate that:  selective constraints among d <dig> protein relaxed after the duplication in  <dig> leptosporangiate orders;  a handful positively selected codons were detected within species of single copy psba, but none in duplicated ones;  a few sites among d <dig> protein were involved in co-evolution process which may intimate significant functional/structural communications between them.
psba  underwent gene duplication in leptosporangiates, in which both copies have been preserved since.
because gene duplication is often followed by the non-fictionalization of one of the copies and its subsequent erosion, preservation of both psba  copies pinpoint functional or regulatory specialization events.
the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving photo system ii  produces almost the entire oxygen in the atmosphere.
the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular evolution of psba  among fern lineages.
the strong competition between ferns and angiosperms for light may have been the main cause for a continuous fixation of adaptive amino acid changes in psba , in particular after its duplication.
unraveling the evolutionary dynamics of this gene is of particular interest owing to its direct role in oxygen production.
