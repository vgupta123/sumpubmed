our data are consistent with the possibility that auxin-responsive transcription can be modulated downstream of tir1-mediated repressor degradation.
mutations in ibr <dig> result in decreased plant height, defective vascular development, increased leaf serration, fewer lateral roots, and resistance to the phytohormones auxin and abscisic acid.
we analyzed double mutants of ibr <dig> with other mutants that dampen auxin responses and found that combining ibr <dig> with an auxin receptor mutant, tir <dig>  enhanced auxin resistance relative to either parent.
like other auxin-response mutants, auxin-responsive reporter accumulation was reduced in ibr <dig>  unlike other auxin-resistant mutants, the aux/iaa repressor reporter protein axr3nt-gus was not stabilized in ibr <dig>  similarly, the aux/iaa repressor iaa <dig> was less abundant in ibr <dig> than in wild type.
in arabidopsis, indole-3-butyric acid response <dig> , a putative dual-specificity protein phosphatase, is a positive regulator of auxin response.
our genetic and molecular evidence suggests that ibr <dig> is a phosphatase that promotes auxin responses, including auxin-inducible transcription, differently than the tir <dig> auxin receptor and without destabilizing aux/iaa repressor proteins.
