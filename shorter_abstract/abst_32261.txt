the incidence of reported cases of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy  caused by infection with neuropathogenic strains of equine herpesvirus  <dig>  has markedly increased over the last decade in many western countries.
most of the abortions in mares in poland from  <dig> to  <dig> were associated with non-neuropathogenic strains of ehv- <dig>  however, the presented data indicate that the neuropathogenic genotype of the virus is also present in polish stud farms.
the purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of the neuropathogenic  and non-neuropathogenic  variants of ehv- <dig> among isolates associated with abortions in polish stud farms.
the results of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism  and sequencing were consistent, and showed that two out of  <dig> abortions  were induced by the neuropathogenic genotype g <dig>  all remaining  <dig> ehv- <dig> positive abortion cases  were caused by the non-neuropathogenic genotype a <dig>
