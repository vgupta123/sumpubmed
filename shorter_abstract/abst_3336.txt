our data provide evidence of rapid diversifying selection in the evolution of the hsp- <dig> gene along three separate lineages, and identified a number of residues showing significant evidence of adaptive evolution.
here we surveyed  <dig> different free-living or parasitic nematodes with the aim of determining whether c. elegans hsp- <dig> was the exception or the norm amongst the nematodes.
hsp- <dig> from the free-living nematode caenorhabditis elegans is unique in that it fails to bind to the specific hsp- <dig> inhibitor, geldanamycin .
we show that ga-binding is associated with life history: free-living nematodes and those parasitic species with free-living larval stages failed to bind ga. in contrast, obligate parasites and those worms in which the free-living stage in the environment is enclosed within a resistant egg, possess a ga-binding hsp- <dig>  we analysed hsp- <dig> sequences from fifteen nematode species to determine whether nematode hsp-90s have undergone adaptive evolution that influences ga-binding.
hsp- <dig> is a multi-functional protein and the rapid evolution of the hsp- <dig> gene presumably correlates with other key cellular functions.
