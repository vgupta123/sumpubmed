using a network approach with a total of  <dig> non-redundant sequences isolated from solanum , nicotiana  and lycopersicon  species, it is demonstrated that the tnt <dig> superfamily can be treated as a population to resolve previous phylogenetic multifurcations.
the network approach enabled the identification of putative "master" sequences and provided evidence that within a genus these master sequences are associated with distinct u <dig> regions.
the study presented here was conducted to characterise tnt1-related sequences in  <dig> wild species of solanum and five cultivars of solanum tuberosum.
the results presented here support the hypothesis that the tnt <dig> superfamily was present early in the evolution of solanaceae.
the resulting rnaseh network revealed that sequences group according to the solanaceae genus, supporting a strong association with the host genome, whereas tracing the u <dig> region sequence association characterises the modular evolutionary pattern within the tnt <dig> superfamily.
