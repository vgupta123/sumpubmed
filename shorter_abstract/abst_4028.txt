although overproduction of the n-terminal catalytic fragment of apra resulted in protein aggregates which could not be resolved, successful heterologous production of the entire apra was accomplished in the presence and absence of the nonnatural amino acid.
this study indicates that the increased size of the methyl group by the introduction of two fluorines is still sufficiently non-sterically demanding, and bodes well for the application of dfm to biophysical studies of protein structure and function in this class of protease.
although invariant in all metzincin proteases, the methionine  <dig> position in apra can be successfully replaced by the nonnatural amino acid dfm resulting in little effect on protein structure and function.
in addition, differential scanning calorimetry indicated no significant alteration in the thermal stability of the modified enzyme.
the alkaline protease from pseudomonas aeruginosa  is a member of the metzincin superfamily of metalloendoproteases.
dfm incorporation was found to only slightly alter the enzyme kinetics of apra.
