additionally, a molecular circadian clock regulates daily cyclic expression in a large proportion of the plant transcriptome modulating multiple developmental processes in diverse plant organs and developmental phases.
indeed, homologs of core clock genes were identified in the grapevine genome and, among them, vvreveille <dig> , showed a consistent circadian expression rhythm in every grape berry tissue analysed.
light signalling components and terpenoid biosynthetic transcripts were specifically induced during the daytime in verdejo, a cultivar bearing white-skinned and aromatic berries, whereas transcripts involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were more prominently regulated in tempranillo, a cultivar bearing black-skinned berries.
thus, in this study, gene expression throughout 24Â h periods in pre-ripe berries of tempranillo and verdejo grapevine cultivars was followed to determine whether different ripening transcriptional programs are activated during certain times of day in different grape tissues and genotypes.
circadian cycling of fruit transcriptomes has not been characterized in detail despite their putative relevance in the final composition of the fruit.
microarray analyses identified oscillatory transcriptional profiles following circadian variations in the photocycle and the thermocycle.
the transcriptome of ripening fruits varies in response to daily environmental changes, which might partially be under the control of circadian clock components.
