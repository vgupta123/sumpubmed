therefore, we performed a series of experiments to investigate how ldb <dig> regulated palate development.
first, we examined the expression of ldb <dig> during normal development, and found that ldb <dig> was expressed broadly in the palatal mesenchyme during early stages of palate development.
the goal of the current study was to determine the importance of ldb <dig> function during craniofacial development in mouse embryos.
lim domain binding protein  <dig>  is a transcriptional co-factor, which interacts with multiple transcription factors and other proteins containing lim domains.
finally, in the ldb <dig> mutant palatal shelves, cell proliferation was abnormal in the anterior, and the expression of wnt5a, pax <dig> and osr <dig>  which regulate palatal shelf elevation, was also altered.
tissue-specific deletions using a conditional knockout allele revealed additional roles of ldb <dig> in the development of the central nervous system, hematopoietic system, and limbs.
the function of ldb <dig> in the neural crest-derived palatal mesenchyme is essential for normal morphogenesis of the secondary palate.
mutants suffered from cleft secondary palate.
we found that the mutant palatal shelves had abnormally blunt appearance, and failed to elevate above the tongue at the posterior domain.
an in vitro head culture experiment indicated that the elevation defect was not due to interference by the tongue.
