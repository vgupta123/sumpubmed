moreover, the multiple-gene mutations could be inherited by the next generation.
we developed a crispr/cas <dig> binary vector set based on the pgreen or pcambia backbone, as well as a grna  module vector set, as a toolkit for multiplex genome editing in plants.
to accelerate the application of the crispr/cas <dig>  system to a variety of plant species, a toolkit with additional plant selectable markers, more grna modules, and easier methods for the assembly of one or more grna expression cassettes is required.
we developed a toolkit that facilitates transient or stable expression of the crispr/cas <dig> system in a variety of plant species, which will facilitate plant research, as it enables high efficiency generation of mutants bearing multiple gene mutations.
this toolkit requires no restriction enzymes besides bsai to generate final constructs harboring maize-codon optimized cas <dig> and one or more grnas with high efficiency in as little as one cloning step.
the toolkit was validated using maize protoplasts, transgenic maize lines, and transgenic arabidopsis lines and was shown to exhibit high efficiency and specificity.

more importantly, using this toolkit, targeted mutations of three arabidopsis genes were detected in transgenic seedlings of the t <dig> generation.
