different dna sequence preferences were observed between h. influenzae ybab, e. coli ybab and b. burgdorferi ebfc, consistent with amino acid differences in the putative dna-binding domains of these proteins.
several years ago, the three-dimensional structures of the ybab orthologs of both e. coli and h. influenzae were determined, revealing a novel "tweezer"-like structure.
however, a function for ybab had remained elusive, with an early study of the h. influenzae ortholog failing to detect dna-binding activity.
to reconcile those results, we assessed the abilities of both the h. influenzae and e. coli ybab proteins to bind dna to which b. burgdorferi ebfc can bind.
both the h. influenzae and the e. coli ybab proteins bound to tested dnas.
members of this protein family are encoded by a broad range of bacteria, including many pathogenic species, and results of our studies suggest that all such proteins have dna-binding activities.
the functions of ybab/ebfc family members in each bacterial species are as-yet unknown, but given the ubiquity of these dna-binding proteins among eubacteria, further investigations are warranted.
three distinct members of the ybab/ebfc bacterial protein family have now been demonstrated to bind dna.
