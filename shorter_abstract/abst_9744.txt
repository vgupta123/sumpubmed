the study used the allen human brain atlas to classify  <dig> brain regions into hierarchically-organized environments based on their expression of  <dig> g protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors, with no a priori reference to the regions’ positions in the brain’s anatomy or function.
the similarity of brain regions was strongly influenced by their anatomical proximity, even when they belonged to different functional systems.
the main cluster of brain regions excluded the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
most of the neocortical areas  clustered in a large, statistically well supported group that included no other brain regions.
in a single framework, they are reconsidered at multiple scales—from individual nuclei and areas to their groups to the entire brain.
as a complex system, the brain is a self-organizing entity that depends on local interactions among cells.
the study presents the first unbiased, hierarchical tree of functional environments in the human brain.
