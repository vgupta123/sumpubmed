decko successfully deleted genomic fragments ranging in size from  <dig> to 3000 bp in four human cell lines.
using a clone-derivation workflow lasting approximately 20 days, we obtained  <dig> homozygous and  <dig> heterozygous promoter knockouts in three human cell lines.
we present a dual crispr tool, decko, which is cloned using a single starting oligonucleotide, thereby affording simplicity and scalability to crispr knockout studies of non-coding genomic elements, including long non-coding rnas.
