in spite of the equal number of net positive charges and histidine residues in histatin- <dig> and − <dig>  less histatin- <dig> is needed than histatin- <dig> for polymerization and bundling of actin.
the relatively low nacl concentration required to dissociate histatin-induced bundles implies that the actin-histatin filaments bind to each other mainly by electrostatic forces.
histatins affect the fluorescence of probes attached to the d-loop of g-actin indicating histatin induced changes in actin structure.
both histatin- <dig> and − <dig> interacts with actin, however, histatin  <dig> binds stronger to actin and affects actin structure at lower concentration than histatin- <dig> due to the extra  <dig> amino acid sequence at the c-terminus of histatin- <dig>  extracellular actin might regulate histatin activity in the oral cavity, which should be the subject of further investigation.
both actin polymerization and bundling by histatins is ph sensitive due to the high histidine content of histatins.
they possess antimicrobial activity against fungi such as candida albicans.
histatin- <dig> has a higher antifungal activity than histatin- <dig> while histatin- <dig> is mostly involved in wound healing in the oral cavity.
we found that these histatins, like other polycationic peptides and proteins, such as ll- <dig>  lysozyme and histones, interact with extracellular actin.
histatin- <dig> and − <dig> induced actin bundles are dissociated by  <dig> and 50 mm nacl, respectively.
the efficiency of actin polymerization and bundling by histatins greatly increases with decreasing ph.
