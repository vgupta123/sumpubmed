having defined the β2-microglobulin protein family, we performed multiple sequence alignments and analysed the residue conservation in homologous proteins to generate a phylogenetic tree.
both thermodynamic and kinetic data fit with the crystallographic structure of the trp95leu variant, which shows how the hydrophobic cavity of the wild-type protein is completely occupied by trp <dig>  but is only half filled by leu <dig>
our results indicate that trp <dig> is highly conserved, whereas some species have a leu in position 95; the replacement of trp <dig> with leu destabilizes β2-microglobulin by  <dig> kcal/mol and accelerates the kinetics of unfolding.
deeply buried in the core, trp <dig> is essential for folding stability, whereas trp <dig>  which is solvent-exposed, plays a crucial role in promoting the binding of β2-microglobulin to the heavy chain of the class i major histocompatibility complex .
we have previously shown that the thermodynamic disadvantage of having trp <dig> exposed on the surface is counter-balanced by the perfect fit between it and a cavity within the mhci heavy chain that contributes significantly to the functional stabilization of the mhci.
