smr training demonstrated advantages absent in the control group, with improvements in surgical skill according to 1) the expert ratings: overall technique  and suture task  ; and 2) with overall time on task , while everyday anxiety  decreased .
by enabling individuals to self-regulate their brainwave activity in the field of optimal performance in healthy individuals, neurofeedback has been found to improve cognitive and artistic performance.
smr-theta neurofeedback training provided significant improvement in surgical technique whilst considerably reducing time on task by 26%.
here we assessed whether two distinct eeg neurofeedback protocols could develop surgical skill, given the important role this skill plays in medicine.
neurofeedback groups received eight 30-minute sessions of eeg training.
importantly the decrease in surgical task time was strongly associated with smr eeg training changes , especially with continued reduction of theta  power.
overall, the data set provides encouraging evidence of optimised learning of a complex medical specialty via neurofeedback training.
notwithstanding, successful within session elevation of the theta-alpha ratio correlated positively with improvements in overall technique .
at training produced marginal improvements in technique and overall performance time, which were accompanied by a standard error indicative of large individual differences.
national health service trainee ophthalmic microsurgeons  were randomly assigned to either sensory motor rhythm-theta  or alpha-theta  groups, a randomized subset of which were also part of a wait-list 'no-treatment' control group .
