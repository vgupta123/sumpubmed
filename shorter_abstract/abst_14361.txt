we demonstrate that prosite and scop have significant semantic overlap, in spite of independent classification schemes.
large and organized latent knowledge on protein classification exists in the form of independently created protein classification databases.
many relationships were extracted between classes of scop and prosite using decision trees.
prediction of function of proteins on the basis of structure and vice versa is a partially solved problem, largely in the domain of biophysics and biochemistry.
by training classifiers of scop using classes of prosite as attributes and vice versa, accuracy of support vector machine classifiers for both scop and prosite was improved.
probabilistic maps were created between classes of scop and prosite allowing predictions of structure using function, and vice versa.
extensive mappings between existing protein classification databases can be created to link the large amount of organized data.
we demonstrate that presented approach can discover new probabilistic relationships between classes of different taxonomies and render a more accurate classification.
novel attributes, 2-d elastic profiles and blocks were used to improve time complexity and accuracy.
