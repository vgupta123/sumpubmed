the amount of phx1+ transcripts sharply increased as cells entered the stationary phase and was maintained at high level throughout the stationary phase.
when we examined sporulation of the Δphx1/Δphx <dig> diploid strain, significant decrease in the formation of meiotic spores was observed.
it supports long-term survival and stress tolerance against oxidation and heat, and plays a key role in the formation of meiotic spores.
decrease in long-term survival was also observed for Δphx <dig> under n- or c-starved conditions.
phx <dig> is a transcriptional regulator whose synthesis is elevated during stationary phase and by nutrient starvation in s. pombe.
in addition, Δphx <dig> mutant was more sensitive to various oxidants and heat shock.
overproduction of phx <dig> increased the synthesis of homocitrate synthase, the first enzyme in lysine biosynthetic pathway, which is labile to oxidative stress.
phx <dig> has a well conserved dna-binding domain called homeodomain at the n-terminal region and is predicted to be a transcription factor in s. pombe.
when we replaced the n-terminal homeobox domain of phx <dig> with the dna binding domain of pap <dig>  a well-characterized transcription factor, the chimeric protein caused the elevation of transcripts from pap1-dependent genes such as ctt1+ and trr1+, suggesting that phx <dig> possesses transcriptional activating activity when bound to dna.
in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, the phx1+  gene was initially isolated as a multi-copy suppressor of lysine auxotrophy caused by depletion of copper/zinc-containing superoxide dismutase .
nutrient shift down to low nitrogen or carbon sources caused phx1+ induction during the exponential phase, suggesting that cells need phx <dig> for maintenance function during nutrient starvation.
here we examined its expression pattern and the phenotype of its null mutant to get clues on its function.
fluorescence from the phx1-gfp expressed from a chromosomal fusion gene demonstrated that it is localized primarily in the nucleus, and is distinctly visible during the stationary phase.
