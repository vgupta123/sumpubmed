the predisposition to exhibiting a particular coping style is due to genetic and environmental factors.
animals experience stress in many contexts and often successfully cope.
gene ontology analyses reveal that many of these core genes are implicated in neurometabolism .
our results expand the molecular mechanisms of stress coping from one focused on the neurotransmitter systems to a more complex system that involves an organismâ€™s capability to handle neurometabolic loads and allows for comparisons with other animal taxa to uncover potential conserved mechanisms.
our results show that proactive and reactive stress coping individuals display distinct basal neurotranscriptomic states.
individuals exhibiting the proactive versus reactive stress coping styles display qualitatively different behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stressors.
using rna-sequencing we quantified the basal transcriptomes from the brains of wild-derived zebrafish lines selectively bred to exhibit the proactive or reactive stress coping style.
weighted gene coexpression network analyses identified one gene module associated with line differences.
we identified  <dig> genes that differed in baseline gene expression levels.
differences in baseline expression of select genes or regulation of specific gene modules are linked to the magnitude of the behavioral response and the display of a coping style, respectively.
together with our previous pharmacological experiment, we identified a core set of  <dig> genes associated with line differences.
