considering its unique vaccine adjuvant property as well as the safe record as an anti-neoplastic agent clinically used in humans during a long period, docetaxel should be further studied for its use in influenza vaccine production.
vaccination remains one of the most effective approaches to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
docetaxel promoted similar ige level to but alum promoted significantly higher ige level than the control.
when co-administered with docetaxel, lower dose antigen  induced similar levels of igg and igg isotypes as well as hi titers to those induced by higher dose antigen .
compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel is another member of taxane family, and is more soluble in water and easier to manipulate in medication.
docetaxel promoted splenocyte responses to h1n <dig> antigen, cona and lps, mrna expressions of cytokines  and t-bet/gata- <dig> by splenocytes.
paclitaxel extracted from the bark of the pacific yew tree taxus brevifola was previously demonstrated to have adjuvant property.
to investigate the adjuvant effect of this compound, we measured the immune responses induced by co-administration of a split inactivated influenza h1n <dig> vaccine antigen with docetaxel.
docetaxel has adjuvant effect on the influenza h1n <dig> vaccine by up-regulation of th1/th <dig> immune responses.
immune responses to vaccination can be enhanced by inclusion of adjuvant in a vaccine.
