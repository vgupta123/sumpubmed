meanwhile, rgd-sak was found to inhibit adp-induced platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner while sak had negligible effect on platelet aggregation.
the present study was performed to characterize the functional properties of rgd-sak, a novel mutant of staphylokinase .
rgd-sak possessed the bifunction to target platelet-rich clots and to block platelets aggregation, and thus may serve as a more potential thrombolytic agent with platelet-targeted thrombolytic and antiplatelet aggregation activities in compared with sak.
biochemical analysis indicated that rgd-sak maintained the similar structure and the fibrinolytic function of sak.
the time required for 50% platelet-rich clot lysis and the concentration required to obtain 50% clot lysis  were reduced significantly across different concentrations of rgd-sak comparing with sak.
it is interesting to hypothesize that the clot lysis efficacy of sak can be enhanced with direct active platelet binding ability, and at the same time the rethrombosis complication after successful recanalization can be minimized with an antiplatelet aggregation activity.
although staphylokianse  is among the most promising blood dissolving agents, it is far from ideal.
