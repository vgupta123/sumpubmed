the pattern of molecular evolution we observe for sex-lethal and its paralogue sister-or-sex-lethal is not characteristic of a duplication followed by neo-functionalization.
rather, evidence suggests a sub-functionalization scenario achieved through the evolution of sophisticated splicing.
sequences of the paralogue sister-or-sex-lethal, in contrast, show a signature of rampant positive selection and relaxation of purifying selection.
in addition, doublesex shows a signature of positive selection and relaxation of purifying selection in the drosophila clade.
the recruitment of sex-lethal as top regulator and memory gene is associated with a significant release from purifying selection in transformer throughout the drosophila clade.
we find that the recruitment of sister-or-sex-lethal was associated with a number of adaptive amino acid substitutions, followed by a tightening of purifying selection within the drosophila clade.
