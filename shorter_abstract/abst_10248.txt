fus and ews are structurally and functionally related and participate in transcriptional regulation and rna processing.
functional examinations of selected target genes identified that fus and ews can regulate gene expression at different levels.
gene ontology analyses showed that fus and ews target genes preferentially encode proteins involved in regulatory processes at the rna level.
the presented results yield new insights into gene interactions of ews and fus and have identified a set of fus and ews target genes involved in pathways at the rna regulatory level with potential to mediate normal and disease-associated functions of the fus and ews proteins.
our results show that fus and ews bind to a subset of actively transcribed genes, that binding often is downstream the poly-signal, and that binding overlaps with rna polymerase ii.
to determine the gene regulatory functions of fus and ews at the level of chromatin, we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing .
