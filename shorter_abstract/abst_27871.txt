in cancer genetics research, tumor biopsies are a mixture of normal and tumor cells from various subpopulations due to tumor heterogeneity.
our method enables sensitive detection of low-frequency single nucleotide variants across different sequencing platforms and will facilitate research and clinical applications such as pooled sequencing, cancer early detection, prognostic assessment, metastatic monitoring, and relapses or acquired resistance identification.
under standard sequencing protocols and depth given in the testing benchmarks,  <dig>  % recall and  <dig>  % precision for ion proton data,  <dig>  % recall and  <dig>  % precision for illumina miseq data were achieved for snvs with frequency > = 1 %, while the detection limit is around  <dig>  %.
liquid biopsies, which monitor circulating tumor dna in blood to detect metastatic potential, also face the challenge of detecting low-frequency variants due to the small percentage of the circulating tumor dna in blood.
we aimed to push down the frequency detection limit close to the position specific sequencing error rates by modeling the observed erroneous read counts with respect to genomic sequence contexts.
sensitive detection of low-frequency single nucleotide variants carries great significance in many applications.
