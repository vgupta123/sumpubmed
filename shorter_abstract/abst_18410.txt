most of the recent drug development programs aimed at nonpeptidic inhibitors targeted at upa have focused on arginino mimetics containing amidine or guanidine functional groups attached to aromatic or heterocyclic scaffolds.
4-chloro-3-alkoxyisocoumarins were synthesized in which the 3-alkoxy group contained a terminal bromine; these were compared with similar inhibitors that contained a charged terminal functional group.
additional variations included functional groups attached to the seven position of the isocoumarin scaffold.
in the present study, upa inhibitors were designed on an isocoumarin scaffold containing uncharged substituents.
molecular modeling of human upa with these uncharged inhibitors suggests that the bromine occupies the same position as positively charged arginino mimetic groups.
this study demonstrates that potent uncharged inhibitors of upa can be developed based upon the isocoumarin scaffold.
