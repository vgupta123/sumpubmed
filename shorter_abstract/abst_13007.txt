sophisticated wavelet-based texture measurements are used to obtain a good description of the characteristic stages in the egfr signalling.
subsequently a dedicated automatic image and data analysis system is developed and applied to extract the phenotype measurement and distinguish different developmental episodes from a huge amount of images acquired through high-throughput imaging.
therefore, a better construction for a classification strategy will support to raise the performance level in our image and data analysis system.
in this paper, we illustrate an integrated analysis method for egfr signalling through image analysis of microscopy images.
the results of performance assessment clearly demonstrate that our hierarchical classification scheme combined with a selected set of features provides a notable improvement in the temporal analysis of egfr endocytosis.
for the image analysis, a phenotype measurement quantifies the important image information into distinct features or measurements.

there is increasing evidence becoming available showing that breast cancer progression is associated with a defect in egfr endocytosis.
in order to find related ribonucleic acid  regulators in this process, high-throughput imaging with fluorescent markers is used to visualize the complex egfr endocytosis process.
our workflow can be applied to drug discovery to analyze defected egfr endocytosis processes.
endocytosis is regarded as a mechanism of attenuating the epidermal growth factor receptor  signaling and of receptor degradation.
in the subsequent data analysis, classification is used to categorize each observation by making use of all prominent measurements obtained from image analysis.
a hierarchical classification strategy is designed to improve the recognition of phenotypic episodes of egfr during endocytosis.
