in this paper, we propose two approaches using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms  for predicting peptides binding to mhc class ii molecules.
the level of difficulty increases when the molecule is promiscuous and binds to a large number of low affinity peptides.
the proposed methods are intended for finding peptides binding to mhc class ii i-ag <dig> molecule – a promiscuous binder to a large number of low affinity peptides.
further, the proposed method was validated and compared on two publicly available benchmark datasets:  an ensemble of qualitative hla-drb1* <dig> peptide data obtained from five different sources, and  quantitative peptide data obtained for sixteen different alleles comprising of three mouse alleles and thirteen hla alleles.
finding the consensus motif facilitating the binding of peptides to a mhc class ii molecule is difficult because of different lengths of binding peptides and varying location of 9-mer binding core.
cross-validation results across experiments on two motifs derived for i-ag <dig> datasets demonstrate better generalization abilities and accuracies of the present method over earlier approaches.
the proposed method outperformed earlier methods on most datasets, indicating that it is well suited for finding peptides binding to mhc class ii molecules.
our experiments show that the proposed moea-based algorithms are better than earlier methods in predicting binding sites not only on i-ag <dig> but also on most alleles of class ii mhc benchmark datasets.
this shows that our methods could be applicable to find binding motifs in a wide range of alleles.
peptides binding to major histocompatibility complex  class ii molecules are crucial for initiation and regulation of immune responses.
