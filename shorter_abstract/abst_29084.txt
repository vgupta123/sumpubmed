pseudomonas sp.1- <dig> was isolated from methyl parathion -polluted activated sludge and was shown to degrade pnp.
this indicated that pseudomonas sp.1- <dig> degraded pnp by two different pathways, namely the hq pathway, and the hydroxyquinol  pathway .
a gene cluster  was identified in a  <dig>  kb dna fragment of a fosmid library, which cluster encoded the following enzymes involved in pnp degradation: pnp 4-monooxygenase , p-benzoquinone  reductase , hydroxyquinol   <dig> -dioxygenase , maleylacetate  reductase , 4-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde  dehydrogenase , and hydroquinone   <dig> -dioxygenase .
however, the information relating to the pnp degradation pathways and their enzymes remain limited.
the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of these genes along with the functional pnp degradation studies identified 4-nc, hq, 4-hs, and ma as intermediates in the degradation pathway of pnp by pseudomonas sp.1- <dig>  this is the first conclusive report for both 4-nc and hq- mediated degradation of pnp by one microorganism.
four genes  were expressed in e. coli and the purified pdcde, pdcg and pdcf gene products were shown to convert hq to 4-hs, 4-hs to ma and ma to β-ketoadipate respectively by in vitro activity assays.
