the orthoptera mtdna recognition sequence of the replication origin may be one of two kinds: a long t-stretch situated in or adjacent to a possible stem-loop structure or a variant of a long t-stretch located within a potential stem-loop structure.
the two kinds of recognition sequences of replication origin suggest that the regulatory sequences involved in the replication initiation process of mtdna have diverged through orthoptera evolution.
a question still remains regarding whether a long thymine-nucleotide stretch  involved in the recognition of the replication origin exists in the control region  of orthoptera mitochondrial dna .
orthoptera mitochondrial genomes  follow the ancestral insect gene order, with the exception of a trnd-trnk rearrangement in acridomorphs and rare trna inversions.
the unique sinochlora mitogenomes reveal that the mtdna architecture within orthoptera is more variable than previously thought, enriching our knowledge on mitogenomic genetic diversities.
additionally, we performed comparative mitogenomic analysis to depict evolutionary trends of orthoptera mitogenomes.
both mitogenomes are characterized by  a large size resulting from multiple copies of an approximately  <dig> bp gc-rich tandem repeat within cr;  a novel gene order , compared to the ancestral order ; and  redundant trns pseudogenes located between trns and nad <dig>  multiple independent duplication events followed by random and/or non-random loss occurred during sinochlora mtdna evolution.
