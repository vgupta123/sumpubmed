expression of ctgf mrna was up-regulated as early as  <dig> hours in cultured human vsmcs after exposed to high glucose condition, followed by ecm components  accumulation.
our data suggest that in the development of macrovascular complications in diabetes, ctgf might be an important factor involved in the patho-physiological responses to high glucose in human vsmcs.
however, whether high glucose could induce the ctgf expression in vascular smooth muscle cells  remains unknown.
therefore, this study was designed to test whether high glucose could regulate ctgf expression in human vsmc.
the effect of modulating ctgf expression on vsmc proliferation and migration was further investigated.
in addition, the modulatory effects of ctgf-sirna during this process suggest that specific targeting ctgf by rna interference could be useful in preventing intimal hyperplasia in diabetic macrovascular complications.
as a consequence of decreased expression of ctgf gene, the deposition of ecm proteins in the vsmc was also declined.
the upregulation of ctgf mrna appears to be tgfβ-dependent since anti-tgfβ antibody blocks the effect of high glucose on ctgf gene expression.
a small interference rna  targeting ctgf mrna  effectively suppressed ctgf up-regulation stimulated by high glucose up to 79% inhibition.
moreover, ctgf-sirna expressing vector partially inhibited the high glucose-induced vsmc proliferation and migration.
