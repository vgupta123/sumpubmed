however, model plants, such as arabidopsis thaliana do not contain all plant genes, and agronomic and horticulturally important genera and species must be individually studied.
a cdna library of reproductive tissues was used to construct a microarray in order to compare gene expression in flowers and leaves.
by combining cdna microarray, bac library, and bombardment assay techniques, we successfully identified flower-directed orchid genes and promoters.
gr, were identified for cloning of their promoter regions.
bac clones of the  <dig> genes, together with  <dig> previously published flower- and reproductive growth-specific genes in onc.
five genes were highly expressed in flower tissues, and the subcellular locations of the corresponding proteins were identified using lip transient transformation with fluorescent protein-fusion constructs.
interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> novel flower-abundant genes were putative trypsin inhibitor  genes , which were tandemly duplicated in the same bac clone.
several molecular biology tools were used to isolate flower-specific gene promoters from oncidium 'gower ramsey' .
