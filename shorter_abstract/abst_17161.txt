by searching for genes homologous to recon  <dig> genes within mammalian genomes, we were able to create draft metabolic reconstructions of five mammals, including the mouse.
however, our non-tissue specific model was unable to predict gene essentiality for many of the metabolic genes shown to be essential in vivo.
our knockout simulation of the lipoprotein lipase gene correlated well with experimental results, suggesting that softer phenotypes can also be simulated.
we mapped the published, detailed reconstruction of human metabolism  to other mammals.
they raise the question if the various successful applications of microbial reconstructions can be replicated in complex organisms.
each draft reconstruction was created in compartmentalized and non-compartmentalized version via two different approaches.
detailed metabolic reconstructions of mammals have recently emerged, including human reconstructions.
the majority of predicted essential genes were also essential in vivo.
we tested the mouse model for phenotype prediction capabilities.
using gap-filling algorithms, we were able to produce all cellular components with three out of four versions of the mouse metabolic reconstruction.
we finalized a functional model by iterative testing until it passed a predefined set of  <dig> validation tests.
we demonstrate that the mouse model can be used to perform phenotype simulations, similar to models of microbe metabolism.
