these results reveal that, although many obps are chemosensory-specific, others may have more general physiological roles.
the expansion of obp gene subfamilies and sequence divergence indicate that the silkworm obp family acquired functional diversity concurrently with functional constraints.
we identified a family of obp-like genes in the silkworm genome and characterized their expression using oligonucleotide microarrays.
as seen in other fully sequenced insect genomes, most silkworm obp genes are present in large clusters.
obps are believed to transport hydrophobic odorants from the environment to the olfactory receptors.
est data and obp expression profiles from multiple larvae tissues of day three fifth instars demonstrated that many obps are expressed in chemosensory-specific tissues although some obps are expressed ubiquitously and others exclusively in non-chemosensory tissues.
their expression profiles suggest that many obps may be involved in olfaction and gustation as well as general carriers of hydrophobic molecules.
