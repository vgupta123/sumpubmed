using topological techniques, including persistence homology and filtered clustering, we performed a comparative transcriptional analysis of human calu- <dig> cell host responses to the different mers-cov strains, with mers-cov eng  <dig> inducing early kinetic changes, between  <dig> and 12 hours post infection, compared to mers-cov sa  <dig>  robust transcriptional changes distinguished the two mers-cov strains predominantly at the late time points.
here, we computationally analyzed gene expression changes in a human airway epithelial cell line infected with two genetically distinct mers-cov strains obtained from human patients, mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig>
through our genomics-based approach, we found topological differences in the kinetics and magnitude of the host response to mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig>  with differential expression of innate immune and pro-inflammatory responsive genes as a result of ifn, tnf and il-1α signaling.
predicted activation for stat <dig> mediating gene expression relevant for epithelial cell-to-cell adherens and junction signaling in mers-cov eng  <dig> infection suggest that these transcriptional differences may be the result of amino acid differences in viral proteins known to modulate innate immunity during mers-cov infection.
clinical features of middle east respiratory syndrome  include atypical pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure that is highly reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome  caused by sars-cov.
the host response is a key component of highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection.
