it is possible that this cycling has an important role in the regulation of t-snare function.
in the present study we investigated localization of the endogenous syntaxin  <dig> and  <dig>
treatment of these cells with n-ethylmaleimide , which is known to inactivate membrane fusion, caused syntaxin  <dig> to accumulate in the trans-golgi network and syntaxin  <dig> in perinuclear membrane vesicles.
our data suggest that syntaxin  <dig> cycles between the plasma membrane and the perinuclear compartment whereas syntaxin  <dig> cycles between the plasma membrane and the trans-golgi network.
endogenous syntaxin  <dig> and  <dig> were found in nrk cells in intracellular vesicular structures in addition to regions of the plasma membrane.
syntaxin  <dig> and  <dig> are t-snares that, according to previous over-expression studies, are predominantly localized at the plasma membrane.
kinetic analysis in the presence of nem indicated that this redistribution of syntaxin  <dig> and  <dig> takes place via actin containing structures.
membrane fusion requires the formation of a complex between a vesicle protein  and the target membrane proteins .
