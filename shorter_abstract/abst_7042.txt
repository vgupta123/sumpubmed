by investigating the relationship between roh and the predicted deleterious and non-deleterious variants, we gained insight into the distribution of functional variation in inbred  regions.
predicted deleterious variants were more enriched in roh regions than predicted non-deleterious variants, which is consistent with observations in the human genome.
there were an average of  <dig>  roh per genome with an average size of ~ <dig> kbp, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kbp.
recent developments in sequencing technology have facilitated widespread investigations of genomic variants, including continuous stretches of homozygous genomic regions.
there was a significant correlation between shared short roh regions and regions putatively under selection .
these patterns are different from those in the human genome but consistent with the natural history of cattle populations, which is confirmed by the significant correlation between shared short roh regions and regions putatively under selection.
in the present study, roh were characterized in four cattle breeds with whole genome sequence data and the distribution of predicted functional variants was detected in roh regions and across different roh length classes.
on average,  <dig> Â % of the genome was located in roh across four cattle breeds.
we also found that increased enrichment of deleterious variants was significantly higher in short  and medium  roh regions compared with long  roh regions , which is different than what has been observed in the human genome.
this study illustrates the distribution of roh and functional variants within roh in cattle populations.
these findings contribute to understanding the effects of inbreeding and probably selection in shaping the distribution of functional variants in the cattle genome.
for cattle, a large proportion of these runs of homozygosity  are likely the result of inbreeding due to the accumulation of elite alleles from long-term selective breeding programs.
