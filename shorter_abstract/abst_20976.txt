further improvement of modeling accuracy could be achieved by the combination of different methods.
short loops can be predicted with high accuracy using structural fragments from other, not necessairly homologous proteins, or by various minimization methods.
it has been shown that classical modeling with modeller is usually better for short loops, while coarse-grained de novo modeling is more effective for longer loops.
template-target sequence alignment and loop modeling are key components of protein comparative modeling.
in particular, we used  <dig> top ranked models from sets of  <dig> models generated by modeller as multiple templates for cabs modeling.
for a representative set of protein structures of various structural classes test predictions of loop regions have been performed using modeller, rosetta, and a cabs coarse-grained de novo modeling tool.
loops of various length, from  <dig> to  <dig> residues, were modeled assuming an ideal target-template alignment of the remaining portions of the protein.
on average, the resulting molecular models were better than the models from individual methods.
even very long missing fragments in protein structures could be effectively modeled.
