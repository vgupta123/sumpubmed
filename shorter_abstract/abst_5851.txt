the opls methodology identifies joint variation within biological samples to enable the removal of sources of variation that are non-correlated  to the within-sample variation.
this ensures that structured variation related to the underlying biological samples is separated from the remaining, bias-related sources of systematic variation.
during generation of microarray data, various forms of systematic biases are frequently introduced which limits accuracy and precision of the results.
we introduce a normalization strategy for multi-channel microarray data based on orthogonal projections to latent structures ; a multivariate regression method.
the effect of applying the normalization methodology on single-channel affymetrix data as well as dual-channel cdna data is illustrated.
we provide a parallel comparison to a wide range of commonly employed normalization methods with diverse properties and strengths based on sensitivity and specificity from external  controls.
