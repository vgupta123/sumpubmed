the cotton  fiber mutation ligon lintless- <dig> is controlled by a single dominant gene  that results in significantly shorter fibers than a wild-type.
gene expression profiling using microarrays suggested roles of reactive oxygen species  homeostasis and cytokinin regulation in the li <dig> mutant phenotype.
in a near-isogenic state with a wild-type cotton line, li <dig> is a model system with which to study fiber elongation.
cotton fiber length is an important quality attribute to the textile industry and longer fibers can be more efficiently spun into yarns to produce superior fabrics.
an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling fiber length can potentially provide a valuable tool for cotton breeders to improve fiber length while maintaining high yields.
no apparent differences in fiber initiation and early fiber elongation were observed between the mutant ovules and the wild-type ones.
microarray gene expression data led to successful identification of an est-ssr marker  that displayed complete linkage to the li <dig> locus.
in the field of cotton genomics, we report the first successful conversion of gene expression data into an ssr marker that is associated with a genomic region harboring a gene responsible for a fiber trait.
the est-derived ssr marker nau <dig> displayed complete linkage to the li <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> and resided in a gene with similarity to a putative plectin-related protein.
the complete linkage suggests that this expressed sequence may be the li <dig> gene.
