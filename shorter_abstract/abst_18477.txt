myostatin  is a member of the transforming growth factor-Î² superfamily that negatively regulates growth of skeletal muscle tissue.
a qualitative analysis of the barramundi mstn- <dig> expression pattern revealed that, in adult fish, transcripts are differentially expressed in various tissues other than skeletal muscles including gill, heart, kidney, intestine, liver, spleen, eye, gonad and brain.
the finding for the first time in finfish mstn of a mirna target site in the 3'utr provides an opportunity for the identification of regulatory mutations on the expression of this gene.
here we report molecular characterization, tissue expression and sequence variability of the barramundi  mstn- <dig> gene.
a first assessment of sequence variability suggested that higher mutation rates are found in the 5' flanking region with several snp's present in this species.
the deduced amino acid sequence was conserved across vertebrates and exhibited characteristic conserved putative functional residues including a cleavage motif of proteolysis , nine cysteines and two glycosilation sites.
a putative micro rna target site has also been observed in the 3'utr  and is highly conserved across teleost fish.
