our covariance estimator can be used together with the ml variance estimator to form covariance matrices.
the estimator performs similarly to the ml variance estimator.
the estimation of a distance between two biological sequences is a fundamental process in molecular evolution.
knowledge of covariances improves any process that compares or combines distances, such as in generalized least-squares phylogenetic tree building, orthology inference, or lateral gene transfer detection.
in large-scale analyses, it may be too costly to compute msas every time distances must be compared, and therefore a covariance estimator for distances estimated from pairs aligned independently is desirable.
its performance is analyzed through extensive monte carlo simulations, and compared to the well-known variance estimator of ml distances.
