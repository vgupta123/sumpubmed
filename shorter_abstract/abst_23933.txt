bi- and tribody molecules are efficiently produced in p. pastoris.
the methylotropic p. pastoris yeast grows in cheap mineral media and is known for its short process times and the efficient production of recombinant antibody fragments like scfvs, bivalent scfvs and fabs.
expression and purification of ph <dig> bibodies and tribodies from pichia supernatant yielded predominantly correctly heterodimerised products, free of light chain homodimers.
in order to address the poor penetration of full sized monoclonal antibodies in tumours, intermediate sized antibodies are being developed.
stable production in ns <dig> cells produced  <dig>  mg pure bibody and  <dig> mg pure tribody per litre.
additionally, the yields of  <dig>  mg pure bibody and  <dig> mg pure tribody per litre supernatant make the production of these molecules in pichia more efficient than most other previously described trispecific or trivalent molecules produced in e. coli.
these results establish the value of p. pastoris as an efficient alternative expression system for the production of recombinant multivalent fab-scfv antibody derivatives.
these recombinant antibody derivatives were efficiently expressed in both mammalian and p. pastoris cells.
based on the anti-muc <dig> ph <dig> fab, we have developed bivalent ph <dig> bibodies and trivalent ph <dig> tribodies of intermediate molecular mass by adding ph <dig> scfvs to the c-terminus of the fab chains using flexible peptide linkers.
