however, little is known about how dreb-type transcriptional repressors modulate plant stress responses.
it appears that rap <dig>  acts as a negative "subregulon" of dreb-type activators and is involved in the precise regulation of expression of stress-related genes, acting to keep stress responses under tight control.
in addition, rap <dig>  can negatively regulate its own expression by binding to dres present in its own promoter.
arabidopsis plants overexpressing rap <dig>  show enhanced sensitivity to cold and drought stresses, while rap <dig> - <dig> and rap <dig> - <dig> t-dna insertion alleles result in reduced sensitivity to these stresses.
our data suggest that rap <dig>  acts as a negative transcriptional regulator in defence responses to cold and drought stress in arabidopsis.
plants respond to abiotic stress through complex regulation of transcription, including both transcriptional activation and repression.
dehydration-responsive-element binding protein -type transcription factors are well known to play important roles in adaptation to abiotic stress.
a hypothetical model for the role of rap <dig>  in modulating plant responses to cold and drought is proposed in this study.
in this study, we report the functional analysis of rap <dig> , a dreb-type transcriptional repressor.
expression of rap <dig>  is strongly induced by drought and cold stress via an aba-independent pathway.
the mechanisms by which dreb-type transcription factors activate stress-induced gene expression have been relatively well studied.
the reduced stress sensitivity of the plant containing the rap <dig>  allele can be genetically complemented by the expression of rap <dig> , but not by the expression of ear-motif-mutated rap <dig> .
stress-induced expression of the rd/cor genes is repressed by overexpression of rap <dig>  and is increased in plants expressing the rap <dig>  allele.
