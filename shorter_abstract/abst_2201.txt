plausible conditions allow hegs to sustain at high frequency through long evolutionary periods, with the endonuclease frequency being either at equilibrium or periodically oscillating.
in recent years, heases have been the focus of extensive research due to their promising potential use in gene targeting procedures for the treatment of genetic diseases and for the genetic engineering of crop, animal models and cell lines.
the predictions of our model may prove important not only for evolutionary theory but also for gene therapy and bio-engineering applications of heases.
using mathematical analysis and computational modeling, we present here a novel account for the evolution and population dynamics of hease genes .
we describe hegs as paradoxical selfish elements whose long-term persistence in a single population relies on low transmission rates and a positive correlation between transmission efficiency and toxicity.
