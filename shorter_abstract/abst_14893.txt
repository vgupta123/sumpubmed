phylogenetic reconstructions by parsimony and maximum likelihood methods revealed an unambiguous evolutionary history only for antennapedia, with a resolved single origin of eyespot-associated expression, and many homoplastic events for notch, distal-less, and spalt.
the diversity in the combinations of genes expressed in association with eyespot formation does not parallel diversity in characteristics of the adult phenotype.
eyespots have greatly diversified under natural and sexual selection, and their formation involves genetic circuitries shared across insects.
the origin and modification of novel traits are important aspects of biological diversification.
we use a model novel trait, color pattern elements on butterfly wings called eyespots, to explore these questions.
our study underscores the importance of widening the representation of phylogenetic, morphological, and genetic diversity in order to establish general principles about the mechanisms behind the evolution of novel traits.
however, little is known about the evolutionary history of the recruitment of those genes, and of the relationship between them -for example, whether the co-option involves whole or parts of existing networks, or whether it occurs by redeployment of individual genes with de novo rewiring.
we investigated the evolutionary history of the recruitment and co-recruitment of four conserved transcription regulators to the larval wing disc region where circular pattern elements develop.
the evolutionary history of gene recruitment is consistent with both divergence from a recruited putative ancestral network, and with independent co-option of individual genes.
we discuss these results in the context of inferring homology.
