through their detailed analysis, we address the untapped resource, ‘bio-inference,’ as well as the differences between text and pathway representation.
there are three main challenges to this task:  the identification of the mapping position of a specific entity or reaction in a given pathway,  the recognition of the causal relationships among multiple reactions, and  the formulation and implementation of required inferences based on biological domain knowledge.
to address these challenges, we constructed new resources to link the text with a model pathway; they are: the genia pathway corpus with event annotation and nf-kb pathway.
here, we show the precise comparisons of their representations and the nine classes of ‘bio-inference’ schemes observed in the pathway corpus.
