to test this hypothesis, we defined the functions most likely regulated by the overlapping gata6/spdef target gene set in mouse intestine, delineated the relationship between gata <dig> chromatin occupancy and spdef gene regulation in caco- <dig> cells, and determined the extent to which prevention of spdef up-regulation by spdef knockout rescues the gata <dig> phenotype in conditional gata <dig> knockout mouse ileum.
gata <dig> occupies a genetic locus located 40Â kb upstream of the spdef transcription start site, consistent with direct regulation of spdef gene expression by gata <dig>  prevention of spdef up-regulation in conditional gata <dig> knockout mouse ileum by the additional deletion of spdef rescued the crypt cell proliferation defect, but had little effect on altered lineage differentiation or absorptive enterocytes gene expression.
deletion of intestinal gata <dig> and gata <dig> results in an altered proliferation/differentiation phenotype, and an up-regulation of sam pointed domain containing ets transcription factor , a transcription factor recently shown to act as a tumor suppressor.
in human caco- <dig> cells, gata <dig> knockdown results in an up-regulation of spdef gene expression, modeling our mouse gata <dig> knockout data.
the hypothesis to be tested is that intestinal gata4/gata <dig> functions through spdef by repressing spdef gene expression.
gata transcription factors are essential for self-renewal of the small intestinal epithelium.
gata <dig> is expressed in the proximal 85% of small intestine while gata <dig> is expressed throughout the length of small intestine.
the goal of this study is to determine to what extent spdef mediates the downstream functions of gata4/gata <dig> in the small intestine.
spdef is a key, immediate downstream effecter of the crypt cell proliferation function of gata4/gata <dig> in the small intestine.
