with the addition of the complete proteomes of hydra magnipapillata and monosiga brevicollis, the investigation of proteins having unique features in early metazoan life has become practical.
most trs cover  <dig> amino acid segments that are comprised of basic units of 5- <dig> amino acids.
tr-units are characterized by a unique composition of amino acids, with cysteine and histidine being over-represented.
most domain families that are characterized as repeats in eukaryotes are found in the tr-proteomes from nematostella and hydra.
the complete proteome of the starlet sea anemone, nematostella vectensis, provides insights into gene invention dating back to the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor.
for over  <dig> of them, translation of the alternative frames would result in long proteins.
the existence of tr-proteins in early metazoan life may have served as a robust mode for novel genes with previously overlooked structural and functional characteristics.
in total, the n. vectensis proteome has about  <dig> unique tr-units, but only a small fraction of them are shared with h. magnipapillata, m. brevicollis, or mammalian proteomes.
we found that 11-16% of n. vectensis proteins contain tandem repeats.
