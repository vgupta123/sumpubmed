binary classification, for example, diseased or healthy, in microarray data analysis has been successful, while multi-class classification, such as cancer subtyping, remains challenging.
we target on the challenging multi-class classification in microarray data analysis, especially on the cancer subtyping using gene expression microarray.
such a new distance measure is employed in gene clustering, and subsequently the gene cluster information is exploited to select a set of genes which can be used to construct a sample classifier.
the proposed novel class discrimination strength vector is a better representation than the gene expression vector, in the sense that it can be used to effectively eliminate highly correlated but redundant genes for classifier construction.
the experimental results show that the constructed classifiers all achieved a higher classification accuracy than the previously best classification results obtained on these four datasets.
such a method can build a classifier to achieve a higher classification accuracy, which is demonstrated via cancer subtyping.
we tested our method on four real cancer microarray datasets each contains multiple subtypes of cancer patients.
