mining lily and tulip sequence data for ssrs  showed that di-nucleotide repeats were twice more abundant in utrs  compared to coding regions, while tri-nucleotide repeats were equally spread over coding and utr regions.
orthologous groups between the two flower bulbs: lily and tulip  and among the three monocot species: lily, tulip, and rice  were determined using orthomcl.
orthologous groups were screened for common snp markers and est-ssrs to study synteny between lily and tulip, which resulted in  <dig> common snp markers and  <dig> common est-ssr.
lily and tulip contigs generated were annotated and described according to gene ontology terminology.
we sequenced and assembled transcriptomes of four lily and five tulip genotypes using  <dig> pyro-sequencing technology.
two transcriptome sets were built that are valuable resources for marker development, comparative genomic studies and candidate gene approaches.
bulbous flowers such as lily and tulip  are monocot perennial herbs that are economically very important ornamental plants worldwide.
in the first set, no snps flanking the target snp  were allowed.
two sets of single nucleotide polymorphism  markers suitable for high throughput genotyping were developed.
