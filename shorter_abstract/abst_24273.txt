rna editing specificity factors can be traced back for more than  <dig> million years of angiosperm evolution and show highly divergent patterns of evolutionary losses, matching the presence of their target editing events.
some 30– <dig> sites of c-to-u rna editing exist in chloroplasts of flowering plant models like arabidopsis, rice or tobacco.
with an extensive chloroplast transcriptome study we identified  <dig> sites of rna editing in amborella trichopoda, approximately the 3- to 4-fold of cp editing in arabidopsis thaliana or oryza sativa.
we investigated the evolution of crr <dig> and rare <dig>  two known arabidopsis rna editing factors responsible for cp editing events ndhbeu467pl, ndhdeu878sl and accdeu794sl, respectively, all of which we now found conserved in amborella.
in a phylogenetically wide sampling of  <dig> angiosperm genomes we find evidence for only one single loss of crr <dig> in chickpea but several independent losses of rare <dig>  perfectly congruent with the presence of their cognate editing sites in the respective cpdnas.
chloroplast rna editing is much more abundant in early-branching than in widely investigated model flowering plants.
nuclear-encoded rna-binding pentatricopeptide repeat  proteins are key editing factors expected to coevolve with their cognate rna editing sites in the organelles.
