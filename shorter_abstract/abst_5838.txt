however, the disruption of zinc homeostasis in Δzur cells likely affects many cellular processes masking direct zur-dependent effects.

seven zur-binding regions constitute the zur primary regulon while  <dig> newly identified targets were associated with a predicted zur box.
in addition, intragenic zur boxes appeared to mediate a transcriptional cis-repressive effect  but the function of zur at these sites remains unclear.
zur binding to intragenic zur boxes could prime an intricate mechanisms of regulation of the transcription elongation, possibly with other transcriptional factors.
the bacillus subtilis zur transcription factor recognizes a specific dna motif, the zur box, to repress expression of genes in response to zinc availability.
using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with hybridization to dna tiling arrays , we reported the identification of  <dig> inter- and intragenic chromosomal sites bound by zur.
using transcriptional fusions an intragenic zur box was showed to promote a full zur-mediated repression when placed within a promoter region.
our findings considerably expand the potential zur regulon, and reveal a new level of complexity in zur binding to its targets via a zur box motif and via a yet unknown mechanism that remains to be characterized.
finally, most zur-binding sites were located near or within genes responsive to disulfide stress.
