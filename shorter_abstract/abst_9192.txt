our implementation reduces the number of false positives and simultaneously increases the number of proteins identified.
we show that proteins can reliably be identified with a single peptide and the sequence coverage for multi-peptide proteins can be increased when using an improved estimation of false discovery rates.
importantly, single peptide identifications achieve defined confidence and the sequence coverage of proteins is optimized.
proteomic protein identification results need to be compared across laboratories and platforms, and thus a reliable method is needed to estimate false discovery rates.
as a result, we improve the number of proteins identified in a human serum analysis by 58% without compromising identification confidence.
