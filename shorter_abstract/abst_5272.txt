we report that h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> are expressed across a wide range of human tissues, they are both acetylated at lysine residues within the n-terminal region and they exhibit similar, but nonidentical, distributions within chromatin.
our results suggest that h2a.z- <dig> preferentially associates with h <dig> trimethylated at lysine  <dig> compared to h2a.z- <dig>  the phylogenetic analysis of the promoter regions of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> indicate that they have evolved separately during vertebrate evolution.
our biochemical, gene expression, and phylogenetic data suggest that the h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> variants function similarly yet they may have acquired a degree of functional independence.
