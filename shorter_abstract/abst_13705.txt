since this method utilizes very limited information about the protein structure, it is not surprising that it has a higher error rate than the approaches that use full 3d fold description.
on the other hand, the comparing of 3d protein structures is computing intensive.
in particular, we derive a closed formula for the probability of obtaining a given score by chance.parameters of local alignment function were optimized using a genetic algorithm.
various notions of the significant change or average change were considered and tried, and the results were all pointing in the same direction.
it has been proposed that secondary structure information can be used to classify  protein folds.
we found that, on average, properly presented information about the loop topology improves noticeably the accuracy of the method but the benefits vary between fold families as measured by log-odds cluster score.
we used the set of beta proteins with at most 30% pairwise identity to test the approach; local alignment scores were used to build a tree of clusters which was evaluated using a new log-odd cluster scoring function.
