optflux has a visualization module that allows the analysis of the model structure that is compatible with the layout information of cell designer, allowing the superimposition of simulation results with the model graph.
it also allows the use of stoichiometric metabolic models for  phenotype simulation of both wild-type and mutant organisms, using the methods of flux balance analysis, minimization of metabolic adjustment or regulatory on/off minimization of metabolic flux changes,  metabolic flux analysis, computing the admissible flux space given a set of measured fluxes, and  pathway analysis through the calculation of elementary flux modes.
the optflux software is freely available, together with documentation and other resources, thus bridging the gap from research in strain optimization algorithms and the final users.
optflux also contemplates several methods for model simplification and other pre-processing operations aimed at reducing the search space for optimization algorithms.
these have been used as the basis to support the discovery of successful genetic modifications of the microbial metabolism to address industrial goals.
over the last few years a number of methods have been proposed for the phenotype simulation of microorganisms under different environmental and genetic conditions.
the main aim of this work is, therefore, to provide a user-friendly computational tool for metabolic engineering applications.
currently, several plug-ins are being developed, including network topology analysis tools and the integration with boolean network based regulatory models.
