the human genome contains a surprisingly small number of abc transporter pseudogenes relative to other known gene families.
intriguingly, targeted knockdown of the transcribed pseudogene abcc6p <dig> resulted in a significant reduction of abcc <dig> mrna expression levels.
the downregulation of abcc <dig> mrna levels by targeted suppression of the expression of its pseudogene abcc6p <dig> provides evidence, for the first time, for a regulatory interdependence of a transcribed pseudogene and its protein coding counterpart in the human genome.
importantly, a significant portion of the abc transporter pseudogenes is transcriptionally active.
recently, we demonstrated that the human ortholog of the rodent testis-specific atp-binding cassette  transporter abca <dig> is a ubiquitously transcribed pseudogene .
pseudogenes are an integral component of the human genome.
the aim of the present study was to establish a complete inventory of all abc transporter pseudogenes in the human genome and to identify transcriptionally active abc transporter pseudogenes.
systematic bioinformatic analysis revealed the existence of  <dig> abc transporter pseudogenes within the human genome.
moreover, we tested the hypothesis that a regulatory interdependency exists between abc transporter pseudogenes and their parental protein coding equivalents.
available information from est and mrna databases and rt-pcr expression profiling indicate that a large portion of the abc transporter pseudogenes  are transcriptionally active and some of them are expressed as alternative splice variants.
