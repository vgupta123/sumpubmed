in this paper we propose a beta-mixture model to describe genome-wide methylation patterns based on probe data from methylation microarrays.
we have developed a beta-mixture model for methylation microarray data.
based on data from colon cancer samples we show that our model captures genome-wide characteristics of methylation patterns.
patterns of genome-wide methylation vary between tissue types.
we estimate the parameters of the model and show that they vary between different tissue types.
we demonstrate that the model can be applied to classify cancer tissue types accurately and that the model provides accessible and easily interpretable data summaries.
it can be used for further analysis, such as sample classification or to detect changes in methylation status between different samples and tissues.
we used methylation microarray data from  <dig> colon cancer samples to assess the model.
further, for each methylation probe the posterior probability of a methylation state  is calculated and the probability that the state is correctly predicted is assessed.
