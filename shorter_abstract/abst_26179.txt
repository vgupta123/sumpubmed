both members of the slc <dig> gene family have been clearly identified in tetrapods; however slc11a <dig> has never been documented in teleost fish and is believed to have been lost in this lineage during early vertebrate evolution.
our data suggests that despite the absence of slc11a <dig>  its functions have been undertaken by one of the slc11a <dig> duplicated paralogs in teleost fish in a case of synfunctionalization, being involved in both iron metabolism and response to bacterial infection.
induction of slc11a2-α and slc11a2-β in sea bass, upon iron modulation or exposure to photobacterium damselae spp.
two different slc <dig> genes were isolated in the european sea bass , and named slc11a2-α and slc11a2-β, since both were found to be evolutionary closer to tetrapods slc11a <dig>  through phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomics.
piscicida, was evaluated in in vivo or in vitro experimental models.
overall, slc11a2-α was found to respond only to iron deficiency in the intestine, whereas slc11a2-β was found to respond to iron overload and bacterial infection in several tissues and also in the leukocytes.
