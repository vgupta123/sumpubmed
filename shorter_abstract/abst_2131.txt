using a large e. coli isotopomer model, different commercially available substrate labeling patterns were tested computationally for their ability to determine reaction fluxes.
based on monte carlo sampling, the dimensionality of experimental data was found to be considerably less than anticipated, suggesting that effectiveness of 13c experiments for determining reaction fluxes across a large-scale metabolic network is less than previously believed.
many commercially available labels are predicted to be outperformed by complex labeling patterns.
we present a novel monte carlo algorithm for finding the optimal substrate input label for a particular experimental objective .
the choice of optimal labeled substrate was found to be dependent upon the desired experimental objective.
while 13c analysis is a useful tool in systems biology, high redundancy in measurements limits the information that can be obtained from each experiment.
carbon- <dig>  analysis is a commonly used method for estimating reaction rates in biochemical networks.
