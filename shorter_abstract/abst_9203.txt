although oscillations of p <dig> have been extensively studied, the mechanism of p <dig> pulses and their physiological roles in dna damage response remain unclear.
we first reproduced digital oscillation of p <dig> as the response of normal cells to dna damage.
subsequent modeling in mutant cells showed that high basal dna damage is a plausible cause for sustained p <dig> pulses observed in tumor cells.
the high levels of basal dna damage are responsible for generating sustained pulses of p <dig> in the tumor cells.
further computational analyses indicated that p53-dependent puma accumulation and the puma-controlled bax activation switch might play pivotal roles to count p <dig> pulses and thus decide the cell fate.
meanwhile, the bax activation switch can count p <dig> pulses through puma accumulation and transfer it into death signal.
our modeling provides a plausible mechanism about how cells generate and orchestrate p <dig> pulses to tip the balance between survival and death.
