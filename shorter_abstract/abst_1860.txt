endogenous flavonoids were shown to be good candidates for exploiting an efficient protection against oxidative stress and pcd induction.
during senescence, strict control of genes regulates ordered degradation and dismantling events, the most remarkable of which are genetically programmed cell death  and, in most cases, an upregulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in the presence of light.
flavonoids are secondary metabolites that play multiple essential roles in development, reproduction and defence of plants, partly due to their well-known antioxidant properties, which could affect also the same cell death machinery.
darkness enhanced cell death  in suspension cell culture, when compared to those grown under light condition.
conversely, pcd was mainly occurring in gsc and further increased by light, as it was shown by cytochrome c release and tunel assays.
red suspension cell cultures  and green suspension cell cultures  were finally grown under either dark or light conditions for 6Â days.
to understand further the effect of endogenously-produced flavonoids and their interplay with different environment  conditions, two portions  of a senescing grapevine callus were used to obtain suspension cell cultures.
light seemed to be an important environmental factor able to induce pcd, especially in gsc, which lacking of flavonoids were not capable of preventing oxidative damage and signalling leading to senescence.
