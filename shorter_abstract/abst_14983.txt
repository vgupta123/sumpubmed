we aimed to evaluate changes in the microrna profiles in the peripheral blood of asthmatic subjects undergoing allergen inhalation challenge.
microrna profiles in peripheral blood samples  were measured by the nanostring ncounter assay to determine changes in mirna levels as these asthmatic subjects underwent an allergen inhalation challenge.
the mirna profile in peripheral blood was altered after allergen inhalation challenge.
cell-specific statistical deconvolution attributed mir- <dig> expression in whole blood to pbmcs.
in addition, four healthy control subjects  were recruited.
ontology enrichment and canonical pathway analyses for target genes suggested several functions and pathways involved in immune response and cell cycle.
while they have been implicated in various diseases, the profile changes in allergen inhalation challenge are not clarified in human.
seven mild asthmatic subjects participated in the allergen inhalation challenge.
these results suggest that allergen inhalation challenge is a suitable method to characterize peripheral mirna profiles and potentially elucidate the mechanism of human asthma.

micrornas are small non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
change in mir- <dig> levels may be implicated in asthma mechanisms.
