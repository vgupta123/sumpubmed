using boyden chamber migration experiments, yellow tetrazolium  conversion, in-cell western, qpcr and immunocytochemistry we show that nagly, at sub-nanomolar concentrations, and abn-cbd potently drive cellular migration in both bv- <dig> microglia and hek293-gpr <dig> transfected cells, but neither induce migration in hek-gpr <dig> or non-transfected hek <dig> wildtype cells.
it offers a novel research avenue for developing therapeutics to elicit a self-renewing population of neuroregenerative microglia, or alternatively, to prevent the accumulation of misdirected, pro-inflammatory microglia which contribute to and exacerbate neurodegenerative disease.
n-arachidonoyl glycine  is an endogenous metabolite of the endocannabinoid anandamide and acts as an efficacious agonist at gpr <dig>  here, we investigate the relationship between nagly, abn-cbd, the unidentified 'abn-cbd' receptor, gpr <dig>  and bv- <dig> microglial migration.
nagly promotes proliferation and activation of map kinases in bv- <dig> microglia and hek293-gpr <dig> cells at low nanomolar concentrations - cellular responses correlated with microglial migration.
qpcr demonstrates that primary microglia, likewise, express abundant amounts of gpr <dig> mrna.
the endogenous cannabinoid system regulates microglial migration via cb <dig> receptors and an as yet unidentified gpcr termed the 'abnormal cannabidiol'  receptor.
the marked potency of nagly acting on gpr <dig> to elicit directed migration, proliferation and perhaps other mapk-dependent phenomena advances our understanding of the lipid-based signaling mechanisms employed by the cns to actively recruit microglia to sites of interest.
importantly, the molecular species of chemoattractant encountered determines if microglia respond with pro- or anti-inflammatory behaviour, yet the signaling molecules that trigger migration remain poorly understood.
