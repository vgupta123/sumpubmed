the goal of this work was to identify structural and functional promoter elements upstream of the coding sequence of the eto gene in order to explore lineage-specific hematopoietic expression and get hints to function.
leukemia associated aml1-eto strongly suppressed an eto promoter reporter in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells.
furthermore, results from chromatin immunoprecipitation showed gata- <dig> binding in vivo to the conserved region of the eto promoter containing the - <dig> site.
the results suggest that the gata - <dig> site may have a role in activation of the eto gene activity in cells with erythroid/megakaryocytic potential.
normal functions of eto homologues have as yet not been examined.
strong eto promoter activity was specifically observed upon transfection of a promoter reporter construct into erythroid/megakaryocytic cells, which have endogeneous eto gene activity.
a putative proximal eto promoter was identified within  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site.
disruption of the evolutionary conserved gata - <dig> consensus binding site repressed transactivation and disruption of the ets <dig> - <dig> consensus binding site enhanced activity of the eto promoter.
thus, trans-acting factors that are essential in erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation govern eto expression.
the promoter was stimulated by overexpression of gata- <dig> into erythroid/megakaryocytic cells.
electrophoretic mobility shift assay with erythroid/megakaryocytic cells showed specific binding of gata- <dig> to the gata - <dig> site.
we demonstrate that the gata- <dig> transcription factor binds and transactivates the eto proximal promoter in an erythroid/megakaryocytic-specific manner.
