we argue that allodapine sociality has been maintained by ecological constraints and the benefits of alloparental care, as opposed to behavioural, genetic or morphological constraints to independent living.
allodapine brood are highly vulnerable to predation because they are progressively reared in an open nest , which provides potentially large benefits for alloparental care and incentives for reproductives to tolerate potential alloparents.
the major lineages of eusocial insects, the ants, termites, stingless bees, honeybees and vespid wasps, all have ancient origins  with no reversions to solitary behaviour.
h. nigrinervis was thought to be the only allodapine that was not social, and our findings therefore indicate that there have been no losses of sociality among extant allodapine clades.
we argue that similar vulnerabilities may also help explain the lack of reversions to solitary living in other taxa with ancient social origins.
