these polymorphisms are drawn from saapdb, which aggregates data from various sources including dbsnp and several pathogenic mutation databases.
this resource contains sequences annotated with domains predicted to belong to structural families in the cath database.
here we present 3dsim , a database and web application facilitating the localization and visualization of single amino acid polymorphisms  mapped to protein structures even where the structure of the protein of interest is unknown.
mappings between domain sequences in gene3d and known structures in cath are obtained using a muscle alignment.
<dig> three-dimensional structures corresponding to cath structural domains are currently included in 3dsim; these domains are distributed across  <dig> cath superfamilies, and provide a comprehensive overview of the distribution of mutations in structural space.
