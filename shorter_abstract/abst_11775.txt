st <dig> accounting for  <dig>  %  was the most prevalent st. the majority  of the isolates tested belonged to clonal complex  <dig>  t <dig> was the most prevalent spa type, accounting for  <dig>  %  .
among 392 s. aureus clinical isolates tested,  <dig>  with fa mic values ranging from 2 μg/ml to ≥128 μg/ml were resistant to fa.
a significant trend towards increased fusidic acid  resistance among staphylococcus aureus with increased duration of use is of concern.
the aim of the present study is to investigate the dissemination of fusidic acid resistance among staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates.

the susceptibility of s. aureus isolates to antimicrobial agents was determined by disc-diffusion method.
fa resistance determinants were determined by pcr and dna sequencing.
a total of  <dig> non-duplicate s. aureus isolates including  <dig> methicillin-resistant s. aureus  isolates, which were isolated from the clinical specimens of patients at a chinese tertiary hospital from january,  <dig> to september,  <dig>  were collected for investigating fa resistance.
the proportions of fa resistance among mrsa and mssa isolates were  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % .
there was a trend of rapidly increased fa resistance among s. aureus and mrsa isolates from  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in  <dig> to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in  <dig>  acquired fa resistance gene, fusb, was present in  <dig>  %  of fa-resistant s. aureus isolates.
increased fa resistance among s. aureus isolates was found in china.
fusb was predominant fa resistance determinant.
the spread of cc <dig> clone, especially novel st5-mrsa- ii-t <dig> clone with high-level resistance to fa, was responsible for the increase of fa resistance.
the minimal inhibitory concertrations of fusidic acid and vacomycin for fusidic acid-resisitant isolates were determined by ager dillution method.
sccmec typing, spa typing and multi-locus sequence typing were used for the determination of molecular characteristics for s. aureus isolates.
a total of  <dig> sequence types  and  <dig> spa types were identified among the  <dig> fa-resistant s. aureus isolates.
st5-mrsa- ii-t <dig> was predominant clone, accounting for  <dig>  %  of fa-resistant mrsa isolates and  <dig>  %  of fa-resistant s. aureus isolates.
five of  <dig> fa-resistant mssa isolates belonged to st630-mssa.
