balb/c mice were placed on rodent chow containing 0 mg/kg , 12 mg/kg , or 120 mg/kg  simvastatin for four weeks, infected intratracheally with s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig> strain tigr <dig>  and sacrificed at  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> h post-infection for assessment of lung histology, cytokine production, vascular leakage and edema, bacterial burden and bloodstream dissemination.
statin therapy also protected through reduced bacterial burden in the lungs.
mice receiving hsd had reduced lung consolidation characterized by less macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and a significant reduction in the chemokines mcp- <dig>  and kc  and icam- <dig> in the lungs compared to control mice.
prolonged oral simvastatin therapy had a strong dose-dependent effect on protection against s. pneumoniae as evidenced by reduced neutrophil infiltration, maintenance of vascular integrity, and lowered chemokine production in the lungs of mice on hsd.
hsd mice also had significantly lower bacterial titers in the blood at  <dig>  and  <dig>  hours post-infection versus controls.
lsd had a more modest effect against s. pneumoniae but also resulted in reduced bacterial titers in the lungs and blood of mice after  <dig> h and a reduced number of infiltrated neutrophils.
to directly test whether statins are protective against streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of cap, we examined the impact of prolonged oral simvastatin therapy at physiologically relevant doses in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia.
neither lsd nor hsd mice had reduced mortality in a pneumonia model where mice received ampicillin  <dig> h after challenge.
recent studies suggest that the reported protective effects of statins  against community-acquired pneumonia  and sepsis in humans may be due to confounders and a healthy user-effect.
thus, oral simvastatin at physiologically relevant doses only modestly protects against pneumococcal pneumonia.
