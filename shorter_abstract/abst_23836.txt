bionetbuilder is an open-source client-server cytoscape plugin that automatically integrates molecular interactions from all major public interaction databases and serves them directly to the user's cytoscape environment.
until recently however, chicken and other eukaryotic model systems had little interaction data available.
additionally, bionetbuilder is now implemented to be part of the gaggle, thereby allowing seamless communication of interaction data to any software implementing the widely used gaggle software.
using bionetbuilder, we constructed a chicken interactome possessing  <dig>  interactions among  <dig>  genes directly in the cytoscape environment.
version  <dig>  of bionetbuilder includes a redesigned synonyms resolution engine that enables transfer and integration of interactions across species; this engine translates between alternate gene names as well as between orthologs in multiple species.
