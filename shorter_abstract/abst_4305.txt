this computational method can be applied to any species of viridiplantae for the successful prediction of mirnas and their targets.
in spite of immense importance, limited information of p. vulgaris mirnas and their expression patterns prompted us to identify new mirnas in p. vulgaris by computational methods.
we have identified  <dig> mature mirnas in p. vulgaris belonging to  <dig> families, of which  <dig> are novel.
<dig> of the predicted mirnas in p. vulgaris were validated with the sequencing data obtained from the small rna sequencing of p. vulgaris.
our findings will contribute to the present knowledge of mirnas and their targets in p. vulgaris.
there is no universal ssr that is conserved among all precursors of viridiplantae, but conserved ssr exists within a mirna family and is used as a signature in our prediction method.
moreover, for all other parameters including normalized shannon entropy, normalized base pairing index and normalized base-pair distance, instead of taking a fixed cut-off value, we have used 99 % probability range derived from the available data.

the computational method developed in this study was also validated by predicting  <dig> mirnas of a. thaliana and  <dig> mirnas of g. max, of which  <dig> for a. thaliana and  <dig> for g. max are existing in mirbase  <dig>
besides conventional approaches, we have used the simple sequence repeat  signatures as one of the prediction parameter.
prediction of known mirnas of a. thaliana and g. max validates the accuracy of our method.
using 80 % sequence identity cut-off, proteins coded by  <dig> targets were identified.
