but although it contributes to basal resistance to tobacco mosaic virus  it is dispensable for sa-induced resistance in inoculated leaves.
rdr <dig> is constitutively expressed and was previously shown to limit invasion of nicotiana benthamiana meristem tissue by potato virus x and thereby inhibit disease development.
thus, rdr <dig> may act in a similar fashion to rdr <dig>  mtrdr <dig> and sa acted additively to further promote recovery from disease symptoms in mtrdr1-transgenic plants.
in mtrdr1-transgenic n. benthamiana plants the spread of tmv expressing the green fluorescent protein  into upper, non-inoculated, leaves was not inhibited.
following sa treatment of mtrdr1-transgenic plants, extractable rdr enzyme activity was increased and western blot analysis of rdr extracts revealed a band cross-reacting with an antibody raised against mtrdr <dig>  expression of mtrdr <dig> in the transgenic n. benthamiana plants was driven by a constitutive 35s promoter derived from cauliflower mosaic virus, confirmed to be non-responsive to sa.
however, in these plants exclusion of tmv.gfp from the apical meristem and adjacent stem tissue was greater than in control plants and this exclusion effect was enhanced by sa.
recovery from disease was markedly enhanced by sa treatment in mtrdr1-transgenic plants whereas in control plants sa delayed but did not prevent systemic necrosis and death.
the laboratory accession of n. benthamiana is a natural rdr <dig> mutant and highly susceptible to tmv.
tmv normally kills n. benthamiana plants but although mtrdr1-transgenic plants initially displayed virus-induced necrosis they subsequently recovered.
this suggests that the effects of sa on mtrdr <dig> are exerted at a post-transcriptional level.
however, tmv-induced symptoms are ameliorated in transgenic plants expressing medicago truncatula rdr <dig>
rdr <dig> is inducible by salicylic acid  and several other phytohormones.
