while combining prediction results of sequence-specific and non-specific binding residues with or operation, the predictor achieves  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % precision, and  <dig> % f-measure.
the proposed framework has two stage predictors: dna-binding residues prediction and binding mode prediction.
in the first stage - dna-binding residues prediction, the predictor for dna specific binding residues achieves  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % precision, and  <dig> % f-measure.
the protein-dna binding mode prediction was introduced to help improve dna-binding residues prediction.
in addition, the results of this study will help with the design of binding-mechanism concerned predictors for other families of proteins interacting with dna.
this article presents the design of a sequence based predictor aiming to identify sequence-specific and non-specific binding residues in a transcription factor with dna binding-mechanism concerned.
protein-dna non-specific binding shows sequence independent interaction for accelerated targeting by interacting with dna backbone.
the predictor for dna non-specific binding residues achieves  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % precision, and  <dig> % f-measure.
