we designed a method for improving the data processing and peptide identification in sample sets subjected to icat labeling and lc-ms/ms analysis, based on cross validating ms/ms results.
heavy/light  pairs quantified but not identified by the ms/ms routine, are assigned to peptide sequences identified in other samples, by using similarity criteria based on chromatographic retention time and heavy/light mass attributes.
eipeptidi significantly increases the number of peptides identified and quantified in analyzed samples, thus reducing the number of unassigned h/l pairs and allowing a better comparative analysis of sample data sets.
finally, the simplified peptide mixture is analyzed by nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry .
the eipeptidi tool is available at  with a demo data set.
then, after whole sample digestion, the labeled peptides are captured selectively using the biotin tag contained in both icat reagents.
such a method has been implemented in a tool, called eipeptidi, which boosts the icat data analysis software improving peptide identification throughout the input data set.
isotope-coded affinity tags  is a method for quantitative proteomics based on differential isotopic labeling, sample digestion and mass spectrometry .
