this study aimed to identify risk factors for active porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  infection at farm level and to assess the probability of an infected farm being detected through passive disease surveillance in england.
farms were more likely to have active prrsv infection if they used the live virus vaccine-porcilis prrs , were located in high pig density areas  or had dead pigs collected .
in particular farms which used live virus vaccine had lower probabilities for detection compared to those which did not.
the results further indicate that a combined approach of surveillance for infection and disease diagnosis is needed to assist effective control and/or elimination of prrsv from the pig population.
data were obtained from a cross-sectional study on  <dig> farrow-to-finish farms conducted from april  <dig> â€“ april  <dig>  the risk factors for active prrsv infection were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
risk factors identified highlight the importance of biosecurity measures for the incursion of prrsv infection.
the probability of detecting an infected farm through passive surveillance for disease was low .
