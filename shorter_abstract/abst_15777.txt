the use of color to encode both characteristics makes the simultaneous visualization almost impossible, requiring these features to be visualized in different images.
in this work, we describe a novel and intuitive code for the simultaneous visualization of these properties.
on the basis blender, we developed bioblender, dedicated to biological work: elaboration of protein motion with simultaneous visualization of their chemical and physical features.
these interactions are mediated by protein features such as electrostatic and lipophilic potentials.
electrostatic and lipophilic potentials are calculated using physico-chemical software and scripts, organized and accessed through bioblender interface.
recent advances in 3d animation and rendering software have not yet been exploited for the representation of biomolecules in an intuitive, animated form.
a new visual code is introduced for molecular lipophilic potential: a range of optical features going from smooth-shiny for hydrophobic regions to rough-dull for hydrophilic ones.
the availability of protein structures enables the study of their surfaces and surface characteristics, based on atomic contribution.
electrostatic potential is represented as animated line particles that flow along field lines, proportional to the total charge of the protein.
