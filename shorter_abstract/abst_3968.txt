therefore, the goal of the present study was to develop an untargeted methodology for performing reproducible metabolomics on in vitro systems.
the study focused on the analysis of intracellular metabolites using nmr, lc-ms and gc-ms, with emphasis on the reproducibility and repeatability of the data.
in vitro cell systems together with omics methods represent promising alternatives to conventional animal models for toxicity testing.
untargeted profiling of the polar and apolar metabolites of in vitro cultured hepg <dig> cells is a valid approach to studying the effects of tcdd on the cell metabolome.
the approach described in this research demonstrates that highly reproducible experiments and correct normalization of the datasets are essential for obtaining reliable results.
several metabolites identified using databases, literature and lc-nanomate-orbitrap analysis were affected by the treatment.
the effects of tcdd on hepg <dig> cells reported herein are in agreement with previous studies and serve to validate the procedures used in the present work.
the observed changes in metabolite levels are discussed in relation to the reported effects of tcdd.
