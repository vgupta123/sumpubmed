geese tlr2- <dig> is a functional homologue of tlr <dig> present in other species and plays an important role in bacterial recognition in geese.
in this study, we cloned the goose tlr2- <dig> gene using rapid amplification of cdna ends and showed that geese tlr2- <dig> encoded a 793-amino-acid protein, containing a signal secretion peptide, an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain, a transmembrane domain and a toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor signaling domain deduced from amino acid sequence.
furthermore, geese infected with mycoplasma gallisepticum  and salmonella enteritidis  showed significant upregulation of tlr2- <dig> in both in vivo and in vitro.
hek <dig> cells transfected with plasmids carrying goose tlr2- <dig> and nf-Îºb-luciferase responded significantly to stimulation with mycoplasma fermentans lipopeptide.
