while the turnover of several metabolites remained unaltered fmt inactivation led to increases pyruvate release and, concomitantly, reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.
the anaerobic degradation of arginine was also reduced in the fmt mutant compared to the wild-type strain.
in order to elucidate how global metabolic processes are affected by the absence of formylated proteins the exometabolome of an s. aureus fmt mutant was compared with that of the parental strain and the transcription of corresponding enzymes was analyzed to identify possible regulatory changes.
bacterial protein biosynthesis usually depends on a formylated methionyl start trna but staphylococcus aureus is viable in the absence of fmt, the trnamet formyl transferase.
the mutant consumed glucose and other carbon sources slower than the wild type.
fmt mutants exhibit reduced growth rates indicating that the function of certain proteins depends on formylated n-termini but it has remained unclear, which cellular processes are abrogated by the lack of formylation.
