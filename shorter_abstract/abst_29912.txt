thus, it is expected that there are different evolutionary patterns in the genes underlying protein synthesis in the seeds of these two groups of plants.
our findings provide evidence to support the suggestion that gene duplication and an accelerated evolutionary rate may be associated with higher protein synthesis in dicots as compared to monocots.
gene duplication, evolutionary rate and positive selection of a major gene family of seed storage proteins , were compared in dicots and monocots.
the results, obtained from five species in each group, show more gene duplications, a higher evolutionary rate and positive selections of this gene family in dicots, which are rich in 11s globulins, but not in the monocots.
seed storage proteins are a major source of dietary protein, and the content of such proteins determines both the quantity and quality of crop yield.
