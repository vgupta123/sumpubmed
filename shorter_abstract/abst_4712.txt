that is why the objective of the hereby study was to assess the gene expression profiles in canine mammary carcinomas  classified by pathologists as grade  <dig> , grade  <dig>  and grade  <dig>  and compare their molecular and pathological classifications.
in our opinion molecular and pathological characterization of canine mammary malignancy can complement one another.
in various types of cancer different intracellular signalling pathways are perturbed, thus the patients with pathologically the same type of cancer often have dissimilar genetic defects in their tumours and respond in a heterogeneous manner to anticancer treatment.
molecular classification of canine mammary tumours is not identical with pathological classification.
the frequency of mammary malignancies in canine patients is even three times over than in human.
