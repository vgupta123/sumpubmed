five s. enterica serotypes were found in avian isolates  and  <dig> from human ones .
<dig> % and  <dig> % of the avian isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime, respectively, whereas human isolates were less resistant to these antibiotics .
the human isolates were recovered from clinical specimens at the university teaching hospital of constantine .
the results of the combined phenotypic and genotypic analysis found in this study suggest a close relationship between human and avian strains and support the hypothesis that poultry production may play a role in the spread of multidrug-resistant salmonella in the human community within the study region.

the aims of this study were to investigate salmonella contamination in broiler chicken farms and slaughterhouses, to assess the antibiotic resistance profile in avian and human salmonella isolates, and to evaluate the relationship between avian and human extended spectrum Î²-lactamase -producing isolates.
susceptibility testing against  <dig> antibiotics including, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ticarcillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, aztreonam, imipenem, ertapenem, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, colistin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fosfomycin, was performed using the disk diffusion method on mueller-hinton agar.
clonality of the avian and human strains was performed using the multi locus sequencing typing method .
forty-five isolated avian salmonella strains and  <dig> human collected ones were studied.
salmonella was screened in different sample matrices collected at thirty-two chicken farms and five slaughterhouses.
