dna microarray data are used to identify genes which could be considered prognostic markers.
in the past, several studies explored the issue of microarray data merging, but the arrival of new techniques and a focus on svm based classification needed further investigation.
however, due to the limited sample size of each study, the signatures are unstable in terms of the composing genes and may be limited in terms of performances.
it is therefore of great interest to integrate different studies, thus increasing sample size.
the results showed that breast cancer classification does not benefit from data merging, confirming the results found by other studies with different techniques.
