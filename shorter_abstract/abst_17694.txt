most of these proteins have no known function and thus, provide a discovery platform for the identification of novel pharmacologically active compounds, innovative vector-based vaccine targets, and immunological markers of vector exposure.
coding sequences were obtained for  <dig>  novel proteins,  <dig>  of which had at least one est expressed in the salivary glands.
these ests have been assembled using previously described ests from the fat body and midgut libraries of the same fly, thus totaling  <dig>  ests, which have been assembled into  <dig>  clusters .
despite library normalization,  <dig> transcripts were overrepresented in the salivary library indicating high levels of expression.
this set includes alleles of previously described gene products, reveals new evidence that several salivary proteins are multigenic and identifies at least seven new polypeptide families unique to glossina.
as part of the effort to sequence the genome of glossina morsitans morsitans, several organ specific, high quality normalized cdna libraries have been constructed, from which over  <dig>  ests from an adult salivary gland library were sequenced.
protein expression was confirmed by 2d gel electrophoresis, enzymatic digestion and mass spectrometry.
concurrently, an initial attempt to determine the immunogenic properties of selected salivary proteins was undertaken.
