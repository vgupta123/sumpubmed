in a phylogenetic tree, pks sequences from different algal phyla form clades that are distinct from pkss from other organisms such as non-photosynthetic protists or cyanobacteria.
our phylogenetic analysis of type i pkss in algae supports an evolutionary scenario whereby integrated at domains were displaced to yield trans-at pkss.
close relationships between type i pks modules from different species or between modules within the same multimodular enzyme were identified, suggesting module duplications during evolution of algal pkss.
together with module duplications, the displacement of at domains may constitute a major mechanism of pks evolution in algae.
in contrast to type i pkss, nonribosomal peptide synthetases  are relatively rare in algae .
in chlorophytes, large proteins in the mda range are predicted in most sequenced species, and pkss with free-standing acyltransferase domains  predominate.
type i pks genes are present in  <dig> of  <dig> analyzed algal species.
here, we have analyzed available full genome sequences of microscopic and macroscopic algae for the presence of type i pks genes.
