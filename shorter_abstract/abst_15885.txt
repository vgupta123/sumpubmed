mutation of the di-acidic export motif led to er retention of lmtk <dig>  and an increase in protein half-life and a concomitant loss of lmtk <dig> from its appropriate terminal destination.
lmtk <dig> has been shown to be involved in the trafficking of the cftr ion channel, the androgen receptor, as well as modulating neurodegeneration.
sequence analysis of the carboxyl tail of lmtk <dig> revealed a putative di-acidic er export motif.
we have identified a di-acidic er export motif within the carboxyl tail of the membrane anchored kinase lmtk <dig>  this sequence is used by lmtk <dig> for its efficient export from the er.
subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and transferrin recycling assays were used to determine the consequence of mutating lmtk2â€™s export motif.
the membrane anchored kinase, lmtk <dig>  is a serine/threonine kinase predominantly localized to endosomal compartments.
loss of lmtk <dig> from endosomal compartments by preventing its release from the er is linked to a reduction in transferrin recycling.
