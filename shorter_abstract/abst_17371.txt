for 2-phenoxyethanol the systemic impact of the high absorption rate and a potential toxicological risk have to be investigated in further studies.
due to its low absorption rates through the skin, octenidine dihydrochloride is suitable for superficial skin treatment in the examined species.
using the method of the external standard, the apparent permeability coefficient, the flux jmax, and the recovery were calculated.
<dig> - phenoxyethanol permeated through all skin samples with the highest permeability in equine, followed by bovine, canine to feline skin.
furthermore, the residues of both components in the skin samples were determined after completion of the diffusion experiment.
a water based combination of  <dig> % octenidine dihydrochloride and 2%  <dig> - phenoxyethanol is registered in many european countries as an antiseptic solution  for topical treatment with high antimicrobial activity for human use, but octenidine based products have not been registered for veterinary use yet.
therefore, permeation studies were conducted using franz-type diffusion cells.
furthermore, both components were found in the stratum corneum and the dermis of all split skin samples with different amounts in the examined species.
the aim of the present study was to investigate whether octenidine dihydrochloride or  <dig> -phenoxyethanol, the two main components of this disinfectant, permeate through animal skin in vitro.
after  <dig> hours no octenidine dihydrochloride was found in the receptor chamber of intact skin samples, while  <dig> % of the topical applied octenidine dihydrochloride permeated through barrier disrupted cattle skin.
