using a seed list of disease-associated genes and a guilt-by-association method, genefriends allows users to quickly identify novel genes and transcription factors associated with a disease or process.
we have created an online tool, called genefriends, which identifies co-expressed genes in over  <dig>  mouse microarray datasets.
we tested genefriends using seed lists for aging, cancer, and mitochondrial complex i disease.
genes involved in common biological processes and diseases are often co-expressed.
genefriends is a resource for biologists to identify and prioritize novel candidate genes involved in biological processes and complex diseases.
two of the novel candidates of unknown function that were co-expressed with cancer-associated genes were selected for experimental validation.
knock-down of their human homologs  in hela cells slowed growth, indicating that these genes of unknown function, identified by genefriends, may be involved in cancer.
using known disease-associated genes in a co-expression analysis may help identify and prioritize novel candidate genes for further study.
we identified several candidate genes that have previously been predicted as relevant targets.
furthermore, several novel candidate genes, that may be suitable for experimental or clinical follow-up, were identified.
co-expressed transcription factors were investigated, identifying c/ebp genes as candidate regulators of aging.
