α-oxoaldehydes are formed as toxic by-products during metabolic activity.
the biologically most important compound of this class, methylglyoxal, results from spontaneous phosphate elimination from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate which are intermediate glycolysis products.
here, results are presented on the effects of methylglyoxal on mycelium growth, stationary phase entry , mitochondrial morphology and protein composition in the filamentous fungus penicillium chrysogenum.
the presented results contribute to the understanding of cellular pathways and mechanisms that are affected by the ubiquitous α-oxoaldehyde methylglyoxal.
furthermore, three proteins are identified that are present in lower abundance when methylglyoxal is added to the growth medium .
mitochondrial morphology is not changed by methylglyoxal.
methylglyoxal leads to growth rate reduction of this fungus so that the entry into the stationary phase is delayed.
