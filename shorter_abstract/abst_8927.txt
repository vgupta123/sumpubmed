a number of early zygotic genes have been identified in drosophila melanogaster and comparisons to sequenced mosquito genomes suggest that some of these early zygotic genes such as bottleneck are fast-evolving or subject to turnover in dipteran insects.
one objective of this study is to identify early zygotic genes from the yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti to study their evolution.
transcriptome profiling by use of high throughput sequencing technologies has proven to be a valuable method for the identification and discovery of early and transient zygotic genes.
we are also interested in obtaining early zygotic promoters that will direct transgene expression in the early embryo as part of a medea gene drive system.
the evolutionary investigation of the klc gene family reveals that duplication is a source for the evolution of new genes that play a role in the dynamic process of early embryonic development.
there is only one klc gene in d. melanogaster and other sequenced holometabolous insects that appears to be similar to aaklc <dig>  unlike aaklc <dig>  aaklc <dig> is expressed in all life stages and tissues tested, which is consistent with the expression pattern of the an.
gambiae and d. melanogaster klc genes.
two novel early zygotic kinesin light chain genes we call aaklc <dig>  and aaklc <dig>  were identified by transcriptome sequencing of aedes aegypti embryos at various time points.
in contrast, aaklc <dig> gene orthologs are found in all three sequenced mosquito species including anopheles gambiae.
these two genes have 98% nucleotide and amino acid identity in their coding regions and show transcription confined to the early zygotic stage according to gene-specific rt-pcr analysis.
the maternal zygotic transition marks the time at which transcription from the zygotic genome is initiated and a subset of maternal rnas are progressively degraded in the developing embryo.
the aaklc <dig>  promoter activity reached ~ <dig> fold over the negative control at  <dig> hr after egg deposition.
aaklc <dig>  may provide a promoter for early zygotic-specific transgene expression, which is a key component of the medea gene drive system.
