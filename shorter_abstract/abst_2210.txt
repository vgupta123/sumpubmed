information on interactions between salmonella and other bacteria in feed production plants and how they affect survival and biofilm formation of salmonella is also limited.
survival, disinfection and biofilm formation experiments were conducted on selected dominant resident flora strains and salmonella.
these results offer an overview of the microflora composition found in feed industry processing environments, their survival under relevant stresses and their potential effect on biofilm formation in the presence of salmonella.
results showed higher survival properties by resident flora isolates for desiccation, and disinfection compared to salmonella isolates.
eliminating the establishment of resident flora isolates in feed industry surfaces is therefore of interest for impeding conditions for salmonella colonization and growth on feed industry surfaces.
the aim of this study was to identify resident microbiota found in feed production environments, and to compare the survival of resident flora strains and salmonella to stress factors typically found in feed processing environments.
moreover, the role of dominant resident flora strains in the biofilm development of salmonella was determined.
in-depth investigations are still needed to determine whether resident flora has a definite role in the persistence of salmonella in feed processing environments.
there is limited knowledge on the presence and survival of the resident microflora in feed production plants.
dual-species biofilms favored salmonella growth compared to salmonella in mono-species biofilms, with biovolume increases of  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold in the presence of staphylococcus and pseudomonas, respectively.
the presence of salmonella enterica serovars in feed ingredients, products and processing facilities is a well recognized problem worldwide.
