on benchmark data sets, our estimation method provided accurate richness estimates  and improved the precision of viquas by 2%-13% and f-score by 1%-9% without compromising the recall rates.
the lack of knowledge on the number of different strains in a quasispecies population is observed to hinder the precision of existing viral quasispecies spectrum reconstruction  methods due to the uncontrolled reconstruction of a large number of in silico false positives.
we also demonstrate that our estimation method can be used to improve the precision and f-score of shorah by 0%-7% and 0%-5% respectively.
the proposed probabilistic estimation method can be used to estimate the richness of viral populations with a quasispecies behavior and to improve the accuracy of the quasispecies spectra reconstructed by the existing methods viquas and shorah in the presence of a moderate level of technical sequencing errors.
by using this approach we improved our recently proposed spectrum reconstruction pipeline viquas to achieve higher levels of precision in reconstructed quasispecies spectra without compromising the recall rates.

in this work, we formulated a novel probabilistic method for strain richness estimation specifically targeting viral quasispecies.
estimating the number of different species  in a mixed microbial population has been a main focus in metagenomic research.
this assumption and the underlying probabilistic formulations of existing methods are not useful for quasispecies populations where the strains are highly genetically related.
existing methods of species richness estimation ride on the assumption that the reads in each assembled contig correspond to only one of the microbial genomes in the population.
