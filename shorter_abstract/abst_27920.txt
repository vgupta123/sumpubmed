leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which affects approx.
in the present study, we have used publicly available, high-throughput screen datasets of chemical moieties which have been adjudged to target the pyruvate kinase enzyme of l. mexicana .
we believe that the models developed in the present study would lead to reduction in cost and length of clinical studies and hence newer drugs would appear faster in the market providing better healthcare options to the patients.
the machine learning approach was used to create computational models capable of predicting the biological activity of novel antileishmanial compounds.
we generated computational models based on machine learning methods and evaluated the performance of these models based on various statistical figures of merit.
we further added a substructure based approach to analyze the molecules to identify potentially enriched substructures in the active dataset.
random forest based approach was determined to be the most sensitive, better accuracy as well as roc.
