furthermore, two diverse mutant lines for amylose content were used to study quantitative expression patterns of  <dig> starch metabolic pathway genes and to identify candidate genes for amylose biosynthesis.
expression pattern analysis of  <dig> starch metabolic pathway genes in two diverse mutant lines  showed higher expression of key genes of amylose biosynthesis  in the high amylose mutant line, in comparison to the parent.
an additional six candidate genes showed over-expression  and reduced-expression  in the high amylose mutant line, indicating that other starch metabolic genes may also contribute to amylose biosynthesis.
furthermore, gene expression analysis of  <dig> starch metabolic genes in the two diverse mutant lines  indicates that in addition to key genes, several other genes  may also be involved in contributing to amylose/amylopectin biosynthesis.
a multiple comparison test  showed that significant variation in amylose and resistant starch content, with respect to the parent, was observed in about  <dig> and 38 % of the mutant lines, respectively.
two methods of amylose measurement in grain starch showed variation in amylose content ranging from ~ <dig> to 76 % in the population.
this population serves as useful germplasm or pre-breeding material for genome-wide study and improvement of starch-based processing and nutrition quality in wheat.
digestibility determines nutritional quality, as high amylose starch is considered a resistant or healthy starch  and is highly preferred for preventive measures against obesity and related health conditions.
therefore, it is necessary to produce wheat lines or populations showing wide variation in amylose/resistant starch content.
in this study, a set of ems-induced m <dig> mutant lines showing dynamic variation in amylose/resistant starch content were produced.
higher expression of amylopectin biosynthesis  was observed in the low amylose mutant lines.
in this study a set of  <dig> ems-induced mutant lines  showing variation in amylose and resistant starch content in seed were produced.
it is also useful for the study of the genetic and molecular basis of amylose/resistant starch variation in wheat.
one-way anova analysis showed significant variation  in amylose and resistant starch content within the population.
the method of in vitro digestion showed variation in resistant starch content from  <dig> to 41 %.
it comprises two glucose polymer fractions, amylose  and amylopectin , that make up about  <dig> and 75 % of total starch, respectively.
in bread wheat , variation in amylose content is narrow, hence its limited improvement.
a population comprising  <dig> ems-induced mutation lines  was produced in a bread wheat  variety.
