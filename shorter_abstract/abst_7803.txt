here we present the de-novo assembly of the cdc and its predicted gene content.
differences in nucleotide usage were found between cdc genes and those on the essential chromosome , including gc3-content, codon usage bias, and repeat region load.

alternaria arborescens is a major pathogen of tomato, with its virulence determined by the presence of a conditionally dispensable chromosome  carrying host-specific toxin genes.
we also identified several predicted cdc genes under positive selection that may serve as candidate virulence factors.
gene ontology terms were assigned, and conserved domains were identified.
to gain a richer understanding of the molecular determinants of virulence and the evolution of pathogenicity, we performed whole genome sequencing of a. arborescens.
we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the cdc in a. arborescens was acquired through horizontal transfer, likely from an unrelated fungus.
genes carrying pks and nrps domains were identified in clusters on the cdc and evidence supporting the origin of the cdc through horizontal transfer from an unrelated fungus was found.
