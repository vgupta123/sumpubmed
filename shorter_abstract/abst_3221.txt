recurrent rearrangements of the human genome resulting in disease or variation are mainly mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination  between low-copy repeats.

we propose that in addition to hervs, other repetitive elements, such as long interspersed elements, may also be responsible for the formation of recurrent cnvs via nahr.
breakpoint sequencing revealed clustering in regions of high sequence identity enriched in prdm9-mediated recombination hotspot motifs.
notably, recurrent deletions of yq <dig> conveying azoospermia, as well as non-pathogenic reciprocal duplications, are mediated by human endogenous retroviral elements .
we developed parameters to identify herv elements similar to those that mediate yq <dig> rearrangements as well as recurrent deletions of 3q <dig> q <dig> .
we subsequently molecularly confirmed recurrent deletion and duplication rearrangements at four loci in ten individuals, including reciprocal rearrangements at two loci.
we hypothesized that herv elements throughout the genome can serve as substrates for genomic instability and result in human copy-number variation .
the presence of deletions and reciprocal duplications suggests nahr as the causative mechanism of herv-mediated cnv, even though the length and the sequence homology of the herv elements are less than currently thought to be required for nahr.
we cross-referenced these predicted susceptibility regions with cnvs from our clinical databases for potentially herv-mediated rearrangements and identified  <dig> cnvs.
