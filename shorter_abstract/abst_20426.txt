we investigate the cycles in the transcription network of saccharomyces cerevisiae.
almost all cycles in the transcription network of saccharomyces cerevisiae are contained in a single strongly connected component, which we call lscc , except for a single cycle of two transcription factors.
this subgraph of the transcription network consists mostly of interactions that are active only in the stress response subnetwork.
apart from those well-defined conditions, the transcription network of saccharomyces cerevisiae is devoid of cycles.
we characterize properties of these cycles and their place in the regulatory mechanism of the cell.
unlike a similar network of escherichia coli, it contains many cycles.
among different physiological conditions, cell cycle has the most significant relationship with lscc, as the set of  <dig> transcription interactions that are active in all phases of the cell cycle has overlap of  <dig> with the interactions of lscc .
conversely, if we remove the interactions that are active in all phases of the cell cycle , the lscc would have only three nodes and  <dig> edges, many fewer than expected.
it was observed that two conditions that were studied and that have no cycles of their own are exogenous: diauxic shift and dna repair, while cell cycle and sporulation are endogenous.
