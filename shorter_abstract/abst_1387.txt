despite the absence of selective pressure, some members of the population evolved antibiotic resistance.
to test the effects of temperate phages on diversification in p. aeruginosa biofilms we experimentally evolved populations of p. aeruginosa for approximately  <dig> generations in artificial sputum medium with or without a community of three temperate phages.
we observed considerable within-population phenotypic diversity in p. aeruginosa populations evolving in the artificial sputum medium biofilm model.
the evolved phenotypes, including antimicrobial resistance, were similar to those observed amongst clinical isolates from cystic fibrosis infections.

however, resistance to ceftazidime and tazobactam-piperacillin was observed more frequently than resistance to other antibiotics, and was associated with higher prevelence of isolates exhibiting a hypermutable phenotype and increased beta-lactamase production.
the frequency of antibiotic resistant isolates varied according to population and the antibiotic tested.
during chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients pseudomonas aeruginosa populations undergo extensive evolutionary diversification.
replicate populations evolved both in the presence and absence of phages converged upon similar sets of phenotypes.
