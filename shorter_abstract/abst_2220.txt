an expression plasmid containing the open reading frame for tung tree  dgat <dig> fused to maltose binding protein and poly-histidine affinity tags was constructed and expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  immunoblotting showed that the recombinant dgat <dig>  was expressed, but mostly targeted to the membranes and insoluble fractions.
nonetheless, the fusion protein was partially purified from the soluble fraction by ni-nta and amylose resin affinity chromatography.
the rdgat <dig> was solubilized from the insoluble fraction by seven detergents and urea, with sds and triton x- <dig> being the most effective detergents.
database search has identified at least  <dig> dgat <dig> sequences from  <dig> organisms, but the expression of any dgat <dig> as a full-length protein in e. coli had not been reported because dgat1s are integral membrane proteins and difficult to express and purify.
the results suggest that recombinant dgat <dig> is degraded extensively from the carboxyl terminus and associated with other proteins, lipids, and membranes.
the objective of this study was to establish a procedure for expressing full-length dgat <dig> in e. coli.
multiple proteins co-purified with dgat <dig> fusion protein.
this study reports the first procedure for expressing full-length dgat <dig> from any species using a bacterial expression system.
prescission protease digestion confirmed the identity of rdgat <dig> and showed extensive precipitation following ni-nta affinity purification.
these fractions appeared yellow in color and contained fatty acids.
the solubilized rdgat <dig> was partially purified by ni-nta affinity chromatography.
diacylglycerol acyltransferases  catalyze the final and rate-limiting step of triacylglycerol  biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms.
