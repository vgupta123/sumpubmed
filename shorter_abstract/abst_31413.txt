in this study, we identified and functionally analyzed members of the sex determination gene family in the golden metallic stag beetle cyclommatus metallifer, which exhibits extreme differences in mandible size between males and females.
taken together, our results highlight the importance of studying the function of highly conserved sex determination pathways in numerous insect species, especially those with dramatic and exaggerated sexual dimorphism, because conservation in protein structure does not always translate into conservation in downstream function.

we performed molecular expression analyses with rt-pcr and functional analyses using rnai on three c. metallifer candidate genes â€“ sex-lethal , transformer- <dig> , and intersex .
in addition to those three genes, we also performed a more complete functional analysis of the c. metallifer dsx gene  to identify the isoforms that regulate dimorphism more fully using exon-specific rnai.
the results of our exon-specific rnai indicated that the essential cmdsx isoform for postembryonic male differentiation is cmdsxb, whereas postembryonic female specific differentiation is mainly regulated by cmdsxd.
these results indicate that the roles of cmsxl and cmtra <dig> in the sex determination cascade are likely to have diverged in stag beetles when compared to drosophila.
our results also suggest that cmix has a conserved role in this pathway.
we constructed a c. metallifer transcriptomic database from larval and prepupal developmental stages and tissues of both males and females.
we queried this database for c. metallifer conserved sex determination genes and identified  <dig> candidate sex determination pathway genes.
genes in the sex determination pathway are important regulators of sexually dimorphic animal traits, including the elaborate and exaggerated male ornaments and weapons of sexual selection.
we identified a total of  <dig> alternative splice variants of the cmdsx gene that code for up to  <dig> separate exons.
despite the variation in rna splice products of the cmdsx gene, only four protein isoforms are predicted.
no differences in expression pattern were found between the sexes for any of these three genes.
knockdown of cmsxl had no measurable effects on stag beetle phenotype, while knockdown of cmtra <dig> resulted in complete lethality at the prepupal period.
