cdna libraries were constructed from anthracnose fungus challenged leaf tissues for transcriptome characterization, and differential gene expression analysis.
gene annotations were used to characterize the transcriptome in yam and also perform a differential gene expression analysis between the resistant and susceptible est datasets.
therefore, this collaborative project was developed for genetic improvement and germplasm characterization of yams using molecular markers.
availability of high quality sequence information is necessary for designing molecular markers associated with resistance.
however, very limited sequence information pertaining to yam is available at public genome databases.
the current investigation is focused on studying gene expression, by large scale generation of ests, from one susceptible  and two resistant yam genotypes  challenged with the fungus.
mining for ssrs in the ests revealed  <dig> unique sequences containing ssrs and  <dig> ssr markers were designed using those sequences.
