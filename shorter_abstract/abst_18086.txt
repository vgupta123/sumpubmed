many efforts seek to use genomics-based strategies to identify genes controlling flavor, and then designing durable molecular markers to follow these genes in breeding populations.
a functional, pcr-based molecular marker was developed that cosegregates with the phenotype in f <dig> and bc <dig> populations, as well as in many other cultivars and wild fragaria accessions.
one candidate encodes an omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase, an enzyme known to participate in lactone production in fungi, noted here as fafad <dig>  this candidate was induced by ripening, was detected in certain harvests, and correlated with Î³-decalactone presence.
