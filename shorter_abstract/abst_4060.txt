we identified two murine and one human-specific retrogene of rap1a and rap1b, which encode proteins that differ by only a few amino acids from their parental rap <dig> proteins.
markedly, human hrap1b-retro and mouse mrap1a-retro <dig> acquired mutations in the 12th and 59th amino acids, respectively, corresponding to residues mutated in constitutively active oncogenic ras proteins.
retrotransposition of mrna transcripts gives occasionally rise to functional retrogenes.
statistical and structural analyses support a functional evolution scenario, where rap <dig> isoforms of retrogenic origin are functionally distinct from their parental proteins.
finally, when tested for their capacity to induce key cellular processes like integrin-mediated cell adhesion or cell spreading, marked differences are seen.
