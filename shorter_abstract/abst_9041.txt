the immunoglobulin heavy chain  3' regulatory region , located at the 3' of the constant alpha gene, plays a crucial role in immunoglobulin production.
we compared the 3'rr organization in genomes of vertebrates to depict the evolutionary history of the region and highlight its shared features.
the nucleotide sequence of the palindrome is not conserved among evolutionary distant species, suggesting pressures for the maintenance of two self-matching regions driving a three-dimensional structure despite of the inter-specific divergence at sequence level.
the information about the conservation of the palindromic structure and the settling in primates of the polymorphic feature of hs <dig>  show the relevance of these structures in the control and modulation of the ig production through the formation of possible three-dimensional structures.
in humans, there are  <dig> copies of the 3'rr, each composed of  <dig> main elements:  <dig> enhancers and a  <dig> bp tandem repeat.
we found that in the  <dig> species in which the whole region was included in a fully assembled contig , the shared elements showed synteny and a highly conserved sequence, thus suggesting a strong evolutionary constraint.
