caucasian sprinters with the ace dd genotype had faster best 400-m sprint time than their ace ii counterparts .
to date, studies investigating the association between actn <dig> r577x and ace i/d gene variants and elite sprint/power performance have been limited by small cohorts from mixed sport disciplines, without quantitative measures of performance.
on average, male caucasian sprinters with the actn <dig> 577rr or the ace dd genotype had faster best 200-m sprint time than their 577xx  and ace ii  counterparts and only one case of ace ii, and no cases of actn <dig> 577xx, had a faster 200-m time than the  <dig> london olympics qualifying .
despite sprint performance relying on many gene variants and environment, the % sprint time variance explained by ace and actn <dig> is substantial at the elite level and might be the difference between a world record and only making the final.
using genetic models we found that the actn <dig> 577r allele and ace d allele dominant model account for  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of sprint time variance, respectively.
aim: to examine the association between these variants and sprint time in elite athletes.
