phylogenetic comparison, analysis of gene structures and information from syntenic regions confirm the paralogous relationship of duxbl and duxb and characterize their relationship with duxa and duxc.
our analysis of the dux family shows the distribution of different homologues across the mammalian class, including events of secondary loss.
here, we investigate the evolutionary history of this multi-member double-homeobox gene family in eutherian mammals.
a survey of non-mammalian genomes identified a single-homeobox gene  as a likely representative homologue of the mammalian dux ancestor before the homeobox duplication.
based on the gene structure maps, we suggest a possible mechanism for the generation of the dux gene structure.
dux <dig> is causally involved in the molecular pathogenesis of the neuromuscular disorder facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy .
it has previously been proposed to have arisen by retrotransposition of duxc, one of four known intron-containing dux genes.
our study underlines how secondary loss of orthologues can obscure the true ancestry of individual gene family members.
