our study led to the identification of members of these gene families in the majority of twenty different anopheline taxa.
a set of tools for the study of the evolution and molecular biology of important disease vectors has, thus, been obtained.
our analysis was carried out using, exclusively, computational approaches, and evaluating both the primary ngs reads as well as the respective genome assemblies produced by the consortium and stored in vectorbase; moreover, the results of rnaseq surveys in cases in which these were available and meaningful were also accessed in order to obtain supplementary data, as were “pre-genomic era” sequence data stored in nucleic acid databases.
in a further attempt to contribute to the elucidation of these variances, the international “anopheles genomes cluster consortium” project  was established, aiming at a comprehensive genomic analysis of several anopheline species, most of which are malaria vectors.
the investigation included the identification and analysis, in most species studied, of ncrna genes belonging to several families, as well as the analysis of the evolutionary relations of some of those genes in cross-comparisons to other members of the genus anopheles.
