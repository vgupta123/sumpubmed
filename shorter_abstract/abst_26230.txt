paraxial protocadherin  plays a crucial role in morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and somitogenesis in mouse, zebrafish and xenopus.
here we demonstrate by loss of function experiments in xenopus embryos that papc regulates another type of morphogenetic movement, the invagination of the ear placode.
knockdown of papc by antisense morpholinos results in deformation of the otic vesicle without altering otocyst marker expression.
depletion of papc could be rescued by full-length papc, constitutive active rhoa and by the closely related pcns but not by classical cadherins.
since neither the cytoplasmic deletion mutant m-papc nor a classical cadherin is able to rescue loss of papc we suggest that the signaling function of the protocadherin rather than its role as modulator of cell-cell adhesion is required during invagination of the ear placode.
papc influences cell-cell adhesion mediated by c-cadherin.
papc signaling via rhoa and wnt5a/ror <dig> activity are required to keep cells aligned in apical-basal orientation during invagination of the ear placode.
