by extending this approach, we were able to identify eqtls controlling network responses for  <dig> out of  <dig> a priori-defined gene networks in a recombinant inbred line population derived from accessions bay- <dig> and shahdara.
this approach has the potential to be expanded to facilitate direct tests of the relationship between phenotypic trait and transcript genetic architecture.
the use of a priori definitions for network eqtl identification has enormous potential for providing direction toward future eqtl analyses.
this technology has been utilized for a range of investigations, from assessments of gene regulation in response to genetic or environmental fluctuation to global expression qtl  analyses of natural variation.
since genes are also known to respond as groups due to their membership in networks, effective approaches are needed to investigate transcriptome variation as related to gene network responses.
current analysis techniques facilitate the statistical querying of individual genes to evaluate the significance of a change in response, also known as differential expression.
