neutrophil migration to an inflamed site constitutes the first line of the innate immune response against invading microorganisms.
these results demonstrate that bjcul can be implicated in a wide variety of immunological functions including first-line defense against pathogens, cell trafficking and induction of the innate immune response since lectin was capable of inducing potent neutrophil activation.
this study evaluated human neutrophil migration and activation by c-type lectin bjcul purified from bothrops jararacussu venom.
utilizing fluorescence microscopy, we observed that biotinylated-bjcul was evenly distributed on the neutrophil surface, selectively inhibited by d-galactose.
