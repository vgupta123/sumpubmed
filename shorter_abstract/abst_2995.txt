we have developed exframe - a reusable web-based framework for genomics experiments that provides 1) the ability to publish structured data compliant with accepted standards 2) support for multiple data types including microarrays and next generation sequencing 3) query, analysis and visualization integration tools  and is available as open-source software.
genome-wide experiments are routinely conducted to measure gene expression, dna-protein interactions and epigenetic status.
even though several repositories have been developed for genomics data, only a few provide annotation of samples and assays using controlled vocabularies.
we present two case studies where this software is currently being used to build repositories of genomics experiments - one contains data from hematopoietic stem cells and another from parkinson's disease patients.
structured metadata for these experiments is imperative for a complete understanding of experimental conditions, to enable consistent data processing and to allow retrieval, comparison, and integration of experimental results.
the framework allows users to query and integrate information across species, technologies, measurement types and experimental conditions.
moreover, many of them are tailored for a single type of technology or measurement and do not support the integration of multiple data types.
