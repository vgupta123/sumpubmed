further analysis reveals that m <dig> is a bipartite composite cis-element, which is recognized by thap <dig> via binding to the actayr sequence module, thereby promoting ternary complex formation with hcf- <dig>  similarly, ikaros binds to the cccr module of the m <dig> motif and this interaction is crucial for recruiting nfkb <dig> to m <dig> harboring genes.
here, we present a quantitative proteomic investigation of the m <dig> motif tf binding landscape in lymphoid cell lines that is further validated by chip experiments and functional assays.
apart from rbp-j that is well known to recruit icn <dig> , the functional role of the hyperconserved m <dig> cis-element in the context of transcriptional regulation of m4-genes in lymphoid cells remains poorly defined.
human m4-promoter genes show enhanced expression in cells of hematopoietic origin, especially in b lymphoblasts and peripheral blood b and t cells.
the motif actayrnnncccr , called m <dig>  was discovered as a putative cis-regulatory element, present  <dig> times in human promoter regions.
transient reporter assays in hek <dig> and loss-of-function experiments in molt <dig> t cells unequivocally demonstrate that binding of ikaros and/or thap <dig> to m <dig> bearing promoters is functionally important and therefore biologically relevant.
accordingly, this study validates our silac-based dna protein interaction screening methodology as a valuable surrogate for a bona fide reverse chip technology.
