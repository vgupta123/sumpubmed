it is likely that these chlamydial expression patterns are survival responses, evolved by the pathogen to enable it to overcome the host's innate immune response.
previous studies in both humans and animal models of chlamydial genital tract infection have suggested that the hormonal status of the genital tract epithelium at the time of exposure can influence the outcome of the chlamydial infection.
of particular interest was the up-regulation in estradiol-supplemented cultures of six genes , which suggest a stress response similar to that reported previously in other models of chlamydial persistence.
the induction of chlamydial persistence is probably a key component of this survival response.
by comparison, progesterone supplementation resulted in a general up-regulation of an energy utilising response.
our data shows for the first time, that the treatment of chlamydial host cells with key reproductive hormones such as progesterone and estradiol, results in significantly altered chlamydial gene expression profiles.
chlamydia trachomatis is a major cause of sexually transmitted disease in humans.
