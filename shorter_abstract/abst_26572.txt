while molecular competition did not affect the plasma metabolite profiles during mcad deficiency, it was a key factor in explaining the characteristic acylcarnitine profiles of multiple acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficient patients.
mfao enzymes accept multiple substrates of different chain length, leading to molecular competition among the substrates.
model simulations predicted that mcad deficiency would have no effect on the pathway flux at low concentrations of the mfao substrate palmitoyl-coa.
here, we combined computational modeling with quantitative mouse and patient data to investigate whether substrate competition affects pathway robustness in mfao disorders.
we conclude that substrate competition is at the basis of the physiology seen in patients with mfao disorders, a finding that may explain why these patients run a risk of a life-threatening metabolic catastrophe.
second, to study the clinical relevance of this mechanism, we used patients’ metabolite profiles and generated a humanized version of the computational model.
we proved computationally that the predicted overload behavior was due to substrate competition in the pathway.
defects in genes involved in mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation  reduce the ability of patients to cope with metabolic challenges.

the patient-specific computational models allowed us to predict the severity of the disease phenotype, providing a proof of principle for the systems medicine approach.
first, we used comprehensive biochemical analyses of wild-type mice and mice deficient for medium-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase  to parameterize a detailed computational model of mfao.
