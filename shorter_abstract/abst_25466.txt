based on this estimation and synteny with model crop genomes we identified the three best candidate genes: wrky, erf/ap <dig> and fhy3/far <dig>
to ascertain the loci determining heading date difference, a set of  <dig> recombinant inbred 5В chromosomal lines as a result of hybridization of cs with cs-5bdic were developed and their heading dates were estimated.
the possible influence of the vrn-b <dig> gene, the most powerful regulator of flowering, located on 5b chromosome, to differences in heading time between cs and cs-5bdic was studied.
data obtained in this study provide a good basis for the subsequent investigation of heading time pathways in wheat.
the sequencing of this gene from cs-5bdic showed that an insertion of a nucleotide triplet produced an additional amino acid in the corresponding protein.
phenotype  – genotype association analysis revealed seventy eight markers in pericentromeric region of 5b chromosome significantly associated with heading date variation.
using the illumina infinium 15 k wheat platform,  <dig> 5b-specific polymorphic markers were detected and a genetic map with  <dig> skeletal markers was constructed.
in this study we used common wheat cultivar chinese spring  and the substitution line of cs with 5b chromosome from t. dicoccoides , different in their heading date by two weeks, to detect determinants of heading date on 5b chromosome.
