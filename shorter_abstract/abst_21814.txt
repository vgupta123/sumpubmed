here we use experimental and population genetic approaches to test hypotheses relating to male production and outcrossing in laboratory and natural populations of p. pacificus sampled from the volcanic island of la réunion.
we find a significant interaction between sampling locality and temperature treatment influencing rates of spontaneous male production in the laboratory.
these include purging of deleterious alleles, inheritance of co-adapted allele complexes, improved hermaphrodite fitness and increased population growth.
linkage disequilibrium extends across long physical distances, but fails to approach levels reported for the partially selfing nematode species caenorhabditis elegans.
finally, despite the potential for outcrossing depression, our results suggest admixture has occurred between distinct genetic lineages since their independent colonization of the island, suggesting outcrossing depression may not be uniform in this species.
finally, we find evidence for admixture between divergent genetic lineages.
elevated rates of laboratory male generation appear to occur under environmental conditions which differ from those experienced by populations in nature.
such elevated male generation may result in higher outcrossing rates, hence driving increased effective recombination and the creation of potentially adaptive novel allelic combinations.
patterns of linkage disequilibrium decay support selfing as the predominant reproductive strategy in p. pacificus.
