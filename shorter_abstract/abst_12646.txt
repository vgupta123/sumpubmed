while folt- <dig> knockout males are fertile, their rate of spermatogenesis was severely diminished, and the males were very poor maters.
germline defects associated with folate deficiency appear widespread in animals, being found in humans, mice, fruit flies, and here, nematodes.
we found no evidence of increased apoptosis in the germline of folt- <dig> knockout mutants, suggesting that germline proliferation is defective.
our results show that folt- <dig> knockout hermaphrodites have a substantially reduced germline, generate a small number of functional sperm, and only rarely produce a functional oocyte.
folt- <dig> hermaphrodites suffer severely diminished lifespan and germline defects that result in sterility.
the mating defect is likely due to compromised metabolism and/or other somatic functions, as folt- <dig> knockout hermaphrodites displayed a shortened lifespan and elongated defecation intervals.
