sketchbio is presented, a tool that incorporates state-of-the-art bimanual interaction and drop shadows to enable rapid construction of molecular structures and animations.
design decisions and their consequences are presented, including cases where iterative design was required to produce effective approaches.
the design decisions, novel features, and inclusion of state-of-the-art techniques enabled sketchbio to meet all of its design goals.
it includes three novel features: crystal-by-example, pose-mode physics, and spring-based layout that accelerate operations common in the formation of molecular models.
this both slows the discovery process and provides opportunities for miscommunication.
working with multiple collaborators, a tool was developed  to enable them to directly construct models and animations.
