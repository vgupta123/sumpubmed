furthermore the new protocol required significantly less parental dna which facilitated the dpni digestion after the pcr amplification and enhanced the overall efficiency and reliability.
our modified protocol significantly increased the efficiency of single mutation and also allowed facile large single insertions, deletions/truncations and multiple mutations in a single experiment, an option incompatible with the standard quikchangeâ„¢.
this modified protocol used a new primer design that promoted primer-template annealing by eliminating primer dimerization and also permitted the newly synthesized dna to be used as the template in subsequent amplification cycles.
mutagenesis plays an essential role in molecular biology and biochemistry.
the results demonstrated that this new protocol imposed no additional reagent costs  but increased the overall success rates.
