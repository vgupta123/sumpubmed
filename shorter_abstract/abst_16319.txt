we have sequenced small-rna libraries from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and rhesus macaque from multiple individuals and tissues.
using patterns of mirna expression in conjunction with a model of mirna biogenesis we used these high-throughput sequencing data to identify novel mirnas in non-human primates.
we therefore added evidence for expression in between one and five tissues to mirnas that were previously annotated based only on homology to human mirnas.
among primates, the human genome is the most extensively annotated.
we predicted  <dig> new mirnas in chimpanzee,  <dig> in gorilla,  <dig> in orangutan and  <dig> in rhesus macaque.
we increased from  <dig> to  <dig> the number mirnas that are located in orthologous regions in humans and the four non-human primate species studied here.
in this study we provide expression evidence for homology-based annotated mirnas and predict de novo mirnas in four non-human primate species.
in contrast, most mirna genes in non-human primates are annotated based on homology without any expression evidence.
we increased the number of annotated mirna genes and provided evidence for their expression in four non-human primates.
similar approaches using different individuals and tissues would improve annotation in non-human primates and allow for further comparative studies in the future.
the algorithm we used was able to predict 64% of the previously known mirnas in chimpanzee, 94% in gorilla, 61% in orangutan and 71% in rhesus macaque.
