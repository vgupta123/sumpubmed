while this complex interplay between proteins has been studied in model organisms, it has not yet been described for the oomycete late blight pathogen phytophthora infestans.
our method unifies available genomic, transcriptomic and comparative genomic data into a single comprehensive network using a bayesian approach.
in both capacities it will improve our understanding of the complex biology of p. infestans and related oomycete pathogens.
the functional association network represents a novel genome-wide data source for p. infestans that also acts as a framework to interrogate other system-wide data.
we present an integrative probabilistic functional gene network that provides associations for  <dig> percent of the predicted p. infestans proteome.
this identified potential novel roles for proteins in spore formation through their links to proteins known to be involved in this process such as the phosphatase cdc <dig>
enrichment of proteins residing in the same or related subcellular localization validates the biological coherence of our predictions.
