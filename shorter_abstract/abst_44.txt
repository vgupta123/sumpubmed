our results indicate that, in the course of yeast evolution, a promoter switches its class with the probability at least ~ <dig>  per time required for the accumulation of one nucleotide substitution at a non-coding site.
genes of yeast saccharomyces have promoters of two classes, class  <dig>  and class  <dig> .
comparison of upstream non-coding regions of orthologous genes from the five species of saccharomyces sensu stricto group shows that among  <dig> genes which very likely have class  <dig> promoters in s. cerevisiae,  <dig> probably have class  <dig> promoters in one or more other species.
conversely, among  <dig> genes which very likely have class  <dig> promoters in s. cerevisiae,  <dig> probably have class  <dig> promoters in one or more other species.
also, for at least  <dig> genes from the set of  <dig> s. cerevisiae genes with class  <dig> promoters, the locations of the tata consensus sequences are substantially different between the species.
