from the period of fi through to flower differentiation, gde belonged to four main biological processes  response to stimuli, including response to oxidative stress;  cellular processes,  cell wall biogenesis, and  metabolic processes including carbohydrate biosynthesis and lipid metabolic process.
in perennial plants, this event is recurrent during tree life and subject to both within-tree and between-years heterogeneity.
genes differentially expressed  were examined between trees artificially set in either ‘on’ or ‘off’ situation, and in which floral induction  was shown to be inhibited or induced in most buds, respectively, using qrt-pcr and microarray analysis.
in the present study, our goal was to identify candidate processes involved in the repression or induction of flowering in apical buds of adult apple trees.
this data set suggests that apical buds of ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees were in different physiological states, resulting from different metabolic, hormonal and redox status which are likely to contribute to fi control in adult apple trees.
investigations on carbohydrate and hormonal fluxes from sources to sam and on cell detoxification process are expected to further contribute to the identification of the underlying physiological mechanisms of fi in adult apple trees.

several key regulator genes, especially tempranillo , floral transition at meristem  and squamosa promoter binding protein-like  were found differentially expressed.
