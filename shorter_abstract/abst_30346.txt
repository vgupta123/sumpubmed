aegypti contains a number of protein coding genes that may be sources of pirna biogenesis with two, traffic jam and maelstrom, implicated in this process in model organisms.
aegypti has a large pirna complement that maps to transposons but primarily gene sequences, including many viral-derived sequences.
aegypti pirna clusters made up a larger percentage of the total genome than those of d. melanogaster but did not contain significantly higher percentages of transposon derived sequences than other regions of the genome.
this, together the more uniform distribution of pirna clusters throughout its genome, suggest that some aspects of the pirna system differ between ae.
the medically important mosquito species aedes aegypti has a large genome size, a high transposon load which includes miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  and an expansion of the pirna biogenesis genes.
in d. melanogaster the majority of pirnas map to these sequences.
aegypti and d. melanogaster, but surprisingly only 19% of mosquito pirnas mapped to transposons compared to 51% for d. melanogaster.
the pirna pathway has been shown in model organisms to be involved in silencing of transposons thereby providing genome stability.
studies of transgenic lines of ae.
we wished to analyze the pirna profile of ae.
several genes of viral origin were also targeted by pirnas.
