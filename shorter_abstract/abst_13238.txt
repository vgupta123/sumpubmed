to eliminate these intervening dna isolation and transformation steps we retrofitted el <dig> with a pbad-driven trfa gene generating strain mw <dig> that supports, independently, both recombineering and copy-number induction.
the pbad-driven copy of cre in el <dig> was replaced seamlessly with a copy of trfa, pcr-amplified from epi <dig> chromosomal dna, to generate mw <dig>  this new strain has been used to both generate, via recombineering, a number of reporter gene fusions directly from pcc1fos-based caenorhabditis elegans genomic clones and to transiently induce copy-number of fosmid and bac clones prior to dna preparation.
escherichia coli strain el <dig> contains chromosomally integrated phage lambda red recombinase genes enabling this strain to be used for modifying the sequence of resident clones via recombineering.
pcc1fos, have been constructed that contain the additional replication origin, oriv, which permits copy-number to be induced transiently when propagated in a suitable host strain, e.g.
