the  <dig> genes encoding peptidases, including seven cathepsin-like cysteine peptidases, four serine carboxypeptidases, a eukaryotic aspartyl protease family protein, an atp-dependent metalloprotease ftsh family protein, three leishmanolysin family proteins and a peptidase family m <dig> protein were identified from a miamiensis avidus cdna library by blast x search.
parasite peptidases have been actively studied as vaccine candidates or drug targets for prevention or treatment of parasitic diseases because of their important roles for survival and/or invasion in the host.
the genetic information and transcriptional characteristics of the peptidases in the present results would be helpful to elucidate the role of peptidases in the invasion of scuticociliates into their hosts.
expression of genes encoding two cysteine peptidases, three leishmanolysin-like peptidases and a peptidase family m <dig> protein was up-regulated in the cell-fed ciliates compared to the starved ciliates.
especially, one cysteine peptidase  and one leishmanolysin-like peptidase  were transcribed more than 100-folds in the cell-fed ciliates.
