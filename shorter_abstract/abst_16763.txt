there is also a need to find a well-defined mscs gene-signature because many recent biomedical studies show that key cellular interaction processes  are dependent on the mesenchymal stem cells within the stromal niche.

the results present tissue-specific signatures for adipose tissue, chorionic placenta, and bone marrow mscs, as well as for dermal fibroblasts; providing a better definition of the relationship between fibroblasts and mscs.
the work integrates several public datasets, as well as de-novo produced microarray and rna-seq datasets.
in this work we define a core mesenchymal lineage signature of  <dig> genes based on a deep comparative analysis of multiple transcriptomic expression data series that comprise:  mscs of different tissue origins;  mscs in different states of commitment;  other related non-mesenchymal human cell types.
although the field of transcriptomics and functional genomics has quickly grown in the last decade, a deep comparative analysis of human mscs expression profiles in a meaningful cellular context has not been yet performed.
the improved biomolecular characterization and the released genome-wide expression signatures of human mscs provide a comprehensive new resource that can drive further functional studies and redesigned cell therapy applications.
