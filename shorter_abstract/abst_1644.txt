the resulting circular representation can be manipulated live within the gui before exporting the diagram as vector graphic in pdf format.
further, various ap-ms experiments can be compared to each other.
we present circular interaction graph for proteomics , which generates circular diagrams for visually appealing final representation of ap-ms data.
cig-p aids to present ap-ms data to a wider audience and we envision that the tool finds other applications too, e.g.
like any other systems biology approach, ap-ms experiments generate a lot of data and visualization has been challenging, especially when integrating ap-ms experiments with orthogonal datasets.
the strength of cig-p is the ability to integrate orthogonal datasets with each other, e.g.
