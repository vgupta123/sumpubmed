we found that b.al/rapaav is resistant to caspase-pathway activation: the caspase-mediated suicide pathway initiates the cell-death process but is insufficient to cause b.al/rapaav death without the subsequent assistance of engulfment.
programmed cell deaths in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans are generally considered suicides.
to better understand the interaction between the engulfment and death processes, we analyzed b.al/rapaav cell death, which has been previously described as engulfment-dependent and hence as a possible murder.
the study of assisted suicides might provide insight into non-cell autonomous influences on cell death.
understanding the mechanism that causes b.al/rapaav to be resistant to activation of the caspase pathway might reveal the basis of differences in the sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli of tumor and normal cells, a key issue in the field of cancer therapeutics.
