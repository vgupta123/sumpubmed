mesostigma shares more genes with the embryophytes than with the chlorophyte chlamydomonas reinhardtii, although both organisms are flagellate unicells.
however, plastidic and mitochondrial metabolic pathways, cytoskeletal proteins and proteins involved in protein folding are more conserved between mesostigma and chlamydomonas than between mesostigma and the embryophytes.
our est-analysis of mesostigma supports the notion that this organism should be a suitable unicellular model for the last flagellate common ancestor of the streptophytes.
in general, cytosolic metabolic pathways, and proteins involved in vesicular transport, transcription, regulation, dna-structure and replication, cell cycle control, and rna-metabolism are more conserved between mesostigma and the embryophytes than between mesostigma and chlamydomonas.
