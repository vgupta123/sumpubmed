from the time course experiment in  <dig> salt concentrations we could identify more than  <dig> proteins and their h/l ratio in at least one experimental condition; for  <dig> protiens at least  <dig> ratio counts were detected in the 24â€‰h time point .
in addition, we combined the analysis of protein synthesis with metabolic profiling to study the dynamic changes of metabolism and proteome turnover under salt stress conditions.
in particular, proline was up-regulated manifold and according to that an increased carbon flow within the proline biosynthetic pathway could be measured.
to study de novo protein synthesis an arginine auxotroph chlamydomonas strain was cultivated in presence of stable isotope-labeled arginine for  <dig> hours.
to investigate the temporal co-regulation of the proteome and metabolome, we applied salt stress to chlamydomonas and studied the time dependent regulation of protein expression and changes in the metabolome.
the main metabolic response to salt stress was observed within the amino acid metabolism.
system-wide analysis of these dynamics will provide novel insights into mechanisms of stress adaptation for higher photosynthetic organisms.
the d <dig> protein was identified among proteins with a high synthesis rates.
we applied pulsed-silac labeling to a photosynthetic organism for the first time and we established a method to study proteome dynamics in the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, an emerging model system for plant biology.
in parallel the analysis of abundance and de novo synthesis of the corresponding enzymes revealed that metabolic rearrangements precede adjustments of protein abundance.
