we studied seed set in two reciprocal crosses between lotus cultivars  to obtain insights into factors that govern fecundity in these experimental hybrids.
pollen viability, stigma receptivity and embryo development were compared for each hybrid and reciprocal cross.
these results suggested that poor pollen fertility, low stigma receptivity, and embryo abortion were responsible for the failure of the crosses ‘molingqiuse’ × ‘qinhuaiyanzhi’, ‘qinhuaiyanzhi’ × ‘molingqiuse’, and ‘aijiangnan’ × ‘guili’.
breeding programs for the water lotus  are hampered by an inability to account for variation in seed set associated with crosses between different cultivars.
similar to the germination results, seed set was substantially reduced in both reciprocal crosses.
pollen viability of the individual cultivars ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, with the highest level  for all cultivars observed from the earliest collected grains .
production of normal embryos ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % at  <dig> d after pollination and from  <dig> to 25% by  <dig> d after pollination.
