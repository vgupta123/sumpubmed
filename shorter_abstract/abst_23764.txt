the simple introduction and tuning of any transcriptional control in the linear dna product renders promoter activation and regulated gene studies simple and versatile.
this approach was applied in common transcriptional models of inflammatory response and the interferon system.
in this report, we describe a cloning-free strategy to generate transcriptionally-controllable linear reporter constructs.
