in addition, these marker candidates annotated with cancer pathways using gene ontology analysis.
using support vector machine  modelling and leave-one-out cross validation , we evaluated the diagnostic performance of single- or multi-markers based on mirna and mrna expression profiles from  <dig> pdac tissues and  <dig> benign pancreatic tissues.
for validation, mirna activity was estimated by mirna-target gene interaction and mrna expression datasets in pancreatic cancer.
for selecting even more reliable and robust markers, we performed validation by independent datasets from the gene expression omnibus  and the cancer genome atlas  data depositories.
using a comprehensive identification approach, we successfully identified  <dig> multi-markers having powerful diagnostic performance for pdac.
microrna  expression plays an influential role in cancer classification and malignancy, and mirnas are feasible as alternative diagnostic markers for pancreatic cancer, a highly aggressive neoplasm with silent early symptoms, high metastatic potential, and resistance to conventional therapies.
in this study, we evaluated the benefits of multi-omics data analysis by integrating mirna and mrna expression data in pancreatic cancer.
our prediction models have strong potential for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
