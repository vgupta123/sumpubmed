pre-evolved wt-vcs were highly evolvable, showing rapid evolutionary adaptation after novel environmental change.
we conclude that evolving a homeostasis mechanisms predisposes lineage to be evolvable to novel environmental conditions.
here we investigate this with computational evolutionary modelling in populations of virtual cells.
during a preparatory evolutionary phase, virtual cells evolved homeostasis regulation for internal metabolite concentrations in a fluctuating environment.
yet, evolving phenotypic plasticity is a comparatively slow process.
moreover, after continued evolution, evolvability can be a viable alternative with comparable fitness to regulated phenotypic plasticity in all but the most rapidly changing environments.
in contrast, when change frequency is high, lineages evolve phenotypic plasticity that allows them to be fit in different environments without mutations.
in vitro evolutionary experiments with microbes show that adaptive, large phenotypic changes occur remarkably quickly, requiring only a few mutations.
the resulting wild-type virtual cell strains  were then exposed to periodic, drastic environmental changes, while maintaining selection on homeostasis regulation.
regulatory mechanisms that ensure a constant internal environment in the face of continuous external fluctuations  are ubiquitous and essential for survival.
it has been proposed that the high evolvability demonstrated by these microbes, is an evolved property.
