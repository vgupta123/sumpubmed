surprisingly, given this strong phylogeographic structure, b. plicatilis s. s. shows a significant correlation between geographic and genetic distance on a global scale .
small vagile eukaryotic organisms, which comprise a large proportion of the earth's biodiversity, have traditionally been thought to lack the extent of population structuring and geographic speciation observed in larger taxa.
our data indicates that geographic speciation, contrary to historical views, is likely to be very important in microorganisms.
by presenting compelling evidence for geographic speciation in a small eukaryote we add to the growing body of evidence that is forcing us to rethink our views of global biodiversity.
analysis of global sequence diversity of b. plicatilis s. s. reveals the presence of four allopatric genetic lineages: north american-far east asian, western mediterranean, australian, and an eastern mediterranean lineage represented by a single isolate.
despite its cosmopolitan distribution and potential for high gene flow, b. plicatilis s. s. is strongly structured at a global scale.
in addition we investigate the relationship between genetic and geographic distances on a global scale to try and reconcile the paradox between the high vagility of this species and the previously reported patterns of restricted gene flow, even over local spatial scales.
here we investigate the patterns of genetic diversity, amongst populations of the salt lake microscopic metazoan brachionus plicatilis s. s.   on a global scale.
we examine the phylogenetic relationships of geographic isolates from four continents using a  <dig> bp fragment of the mitochondrial coi gene to investigate patterns of phylogeographic subdivision in this species.
ibd patterns have traditionally been interpreted to indicate migration-drift equilibrium, although in this system equilibrium conditions are incompatible with the observed genetic structure.
