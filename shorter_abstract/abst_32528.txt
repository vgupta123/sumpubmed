in the case of a binary  trait, the parallel workflow of mbmdr- <dig> .
in this work we present a new version of maxt, requiring an amount of memory independent from the number of genetic effects to be investigated.
<dig> analyzes all gene-gene interactions with a dataset of  <dig>  snps typed on  <dig> individuals within  <dig> days and  <dig> hours, using  <dig> permutations of the trait to assess statistical significance, on a cluster composed of  <dig> blades, containing each four quad-core amd opteron processor  <dig>  <dig>  ghz.
gene-gene interaction studies will require a memory proportional to the squared number of snps.
in this context, the maxt algorithm is one technique to control the false-positive rate.
in the case of a continuous trait, a similar run takes  <dig> days.
the quest for gene-gene interactions poses severe multiple-testing problems.
the software is illustrated on real-life data for crohnâ€™s disease.
<dig>  we evaluate the new implementation in terms of memory efficiency and speed using simulated data.
a new implementation to reach genome-wide epistasis screening is under construction.
hence, cache problems are likely to occur, increasing the computation time.
our software is the first implementation of the mb-mdr methodology able to solve large-scale snp-snp interactions problems within a few days, without using much memory, while adequately controlling the type i error rates.
