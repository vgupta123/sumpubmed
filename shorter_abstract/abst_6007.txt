paralogy studies and phylogenetic analysis of six gene families suggests that the cyp <dig> gene region was structured through "en bloc" genomic duplication .
four gene families have specifically duplicated in the vertebrate lineage.
we propose that cyp <dig> duplicated in the vertebrate lineage to yield four paralogues, followed by the subsequent loss of all but one gene in vertebrate evolution.
contrary to previous suggestions, our data indicates an invertebrate origin for the aromatase gene, given the striking conservation pattern in both gene order and gene content, and the presence of aromatase in amphioxus.
finally, we describe the first invertebrate cyp <dig> sequence, from branchiostoma floridae.
at present it is unclear whether this genomic location is ancestral  or derived .
finally, we suggest that agnathans and lophotrocozoan protostomes should be investigated for the presence of aromatase.
a single inversion in gene order has taken place, probably in the mammalian lineage.
here we determine the "genomic environment" around cyp <dig> in three vertebrate species homo sapiens, tetraodon nigroviridis and xenopus tropicalis.
furthermore, we also determine that this region has retained the same gene content since the divergence of actinopterygii and tetrapods.
