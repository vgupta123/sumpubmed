in the current study we show that high-resolution melt curve analysis  is a simple, cost-saving tool to quickly study clonal variation without prior nucleotide sequence knowledge.
hrma results nicely matched those obtained with elisa and compared favourably to dna fingerprinting of restriction digested clone insert-pcr.
applied to the analysis of clones obtained after phage display antibody selection, hrma facilitated a quick overview of the overall success as well as the identification of identical clones.
