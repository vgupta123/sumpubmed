two cdna libraries were constructed from the male gonads of calomera littoralis and cephalota litorea.
the objective of this study was to identify seminal fluid proteins  that may contribute to the study of the reproductive system of tiger beetles , a group of more than  <dig>  species distributed worldwide that occupy a great diversity of habitats.
we have identified four novel putative sfps of cicindelids, of which similarity searches did not show homologues with known function.
this work represents the first characterisation of putative sfps in adephagan species of the order coleoptera.
searches for homology in other cicindelids showed one lineage specific sfps , only present in the closely related species c. littoralis and lophyra flexuosa and two conserved sfp present in other tiger beetles species tested.
the results will serve as a foundation for further studies aimed to understand gene  functions and their evolutionary implications in this group of ecologically relevant beetles.
expressed sequence tags  were analysed by bioinformatics approaches and  <dig> unigenes were selected as candidate sfps, which were submitted to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  to identify patterns of tissue-specific expression.

the study of proteins transferred through semen can provide important information for biological questions such as adaptive evolution, the origin of new species and species richness.
however, two of the protein classes  predicted by protfun are similar to sfps reported in other insects.
