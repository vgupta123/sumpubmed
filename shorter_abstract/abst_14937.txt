regarding regulatory networks, a broad spectrum of methods are dedicated to their analysis although logical modelling remains the major method to take charge of large-scale networks.
we present flexflux, an application implementing a new way to combine the analysis of both metabolic and regulatory networks, based on simulations that do not require kinetic parameters and can be applied to genome-scale networks.
flexflux is based on seeking regulatory network steady-states by performing synchronous updates of multi-state qualitative initial values.
the classical method used for metabolic flux analysis is flux balance analysis , which is constraint-based and relies on the assumption of steady-state metabolite concentrations throughout the network.

the integrated analysis of both regulatory and metabolic networks appears very insightful but is not straightforward because of the distinct characteristics of both networks.
it can be defined as a research tool that enables a better understanding of both regulatory and metabolic networks based on steady-state simulations.
as input, flexflux uses the standards systems biology markup language  and sbml qualitative models package  extension  file formats and provides a set of fba based functions.
