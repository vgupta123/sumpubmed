hepatic pemt activity did not differ between intact female and male cats and no changes upon spaying/neutering were observed.
feline hepatic lipidosis  is a common cholestatic disease affecting cats of any breed, age and sex.
likewise, no significant differences in liver pc content and pemt-specific polyunsaturated pc species were found between the sexes and before or after spaying/neutering.
both choline deficiency and low hepatic phosphatidylethanolamine n-methyltransferase  activity are associated with hepatic lipidosis  in humans, mice and rats.
from six female and six male cats pemt activity was assayed directly in liver biopsies taken before and after spaying/neutering, and assessed indirectly by analyses of pemtâ€“specific hepatic phosphatidylcholine  species and plasma choline levels.
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of sex hormones on choline synthesis via the pemt pathway in healthy male and female cats before and after spaying/neutering, when fed a diet with recommended dietary choline content.
these results suggest that choline synthesis in cats differs from what is observed in humans, mice and rats.
the lack of evident influence of sex hormones on the pemt pathway makes it unlikely that spaying/neutering predisposes cats for hl by causing pc deficiency as suggested in other species.
