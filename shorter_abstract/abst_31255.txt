this study applies immunoaffinity chromatography to purify bdh, the membrane-bound and lipid-dependent enzyme, as a  <dig> kda single polypeptide chain.
in addition, bacterial bdh isolation was achieved in a two-step purification procedure, improving the knowledge of an enzyme involved in the lipid metabolism of a unique hibernating mammal.
purifying bdh from jerboa liver overcomes its low specific activity in mitochondria for further biochemical characterization of the enzyme.
this new procedure is based on the use of polyclonal antibodies raised against bdh from bacterial pseudomonas aeruginosa.
even though the jaculus orientalis genome has not yet been sequenced, for the first time a d-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase cdna from jerboa was cloned and sequenced.
sequence alignment revealed conserved putative amino acids for possible nad+ interaction.
here, we report an advanced purification method of the mammalian bdh applied to the liver enzyme from jerboa , a hibernating rodent adapted to extreme diet and environmental conditions.
