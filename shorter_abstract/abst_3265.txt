while probe-design is a major research area, relatively little work has been reported on the optimization of microarray protocols.
this is particularly critical for studies of transcription factor expression, or the inference and study of regulatory networks.
while genes from thousands of gene ontology categories were affected, transcription factors and other low-copy-number regulators were disproportionately lost.
we can ensure, however, that optimization results are independent of the samples and the specific measures used for calibration.
well calibrated hybridization conditions are thus easily achieved and necessary for the efficient detection of differential expression.
with the growing availability of entire genome sequences, an increasing number of scientists can exploit oligonucleotide microarrays for genome-scale expression studies.
they are essential for the sensitive pro filing of low-copy-number molecules.
both simulations and spike-in experiments confirmed an unbiased determination of generally optimal experimental conditions.
as shown in this study, suboptimal conditions can have considerable impact on biologically relevant observations.
for example, deviation from the optimal temperature by one degree celsius lead to a loss of up to 44% of differentially expressed genes identified.
