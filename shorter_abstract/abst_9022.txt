to reconstruct the origin of this protein family, we identified and categorised adar family members encoded in the genomes and/or transcriptomes of early-branching metazoan and closely related non-metazoan taxa, including thirteen sponge and ten ctenophore species.
depending on the relationship of sponges and ctenophores to the rest of the metazoa, this is consistent with either adar <dig> being lost in ctenophores, as it has been in multiple metazoan lineages, or being an innovation that evolved after ctenophores diverged from the rest of the animal kingdom.
the modern vertebrate adar family is comprised of adad, adar <dig> and adar <dig>  each of which has a conserved domain architecture.

the adar family appears to be a metazoan innovation, with all family members in place in the earliest phyletic branches of the crown metazoa.
the presence of adars in sponges and ctenophores is consistent with a-to-i editing being a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that was used by the last common ancestor to all living animals and subsequently has been preserved in most modern lineages.
