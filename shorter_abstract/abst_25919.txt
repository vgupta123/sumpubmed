a database consisting of  <dig>  unique transcripts was constructed, of which  <dig>   could be annotated by similarity and  <dig>  received a go functional annotation.
statistical analysis identified  <dig> transcripts that are significantly down-regulated in deformed individuals compared to normal fish, with a significant enrichment in genes related to nervous system development and functioning.
the microarray platform developed for the european sea bass has a high level of flexibility, reliability, and reproducibility.
despite the well known limitations in achieving a proper functional annotation in non-model species, sufficient information was obtained to identify biological processes that are significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes.
functional genomics offers the possibility to discover the molecular mechanisms underlying productive traits in farmed fish, and a step towards the application of marker assisted selection methods in this species.
to this end, we report here on the development of an oligo dna microarray for d. labrax.
two non-overlapping 60mer probes were designed for each unique transcript and in-situ synthesized on glass slides using agilent sureprintâ„¢ technology.
the european sea bass  is a marine fish of great importance for fisheries and aquaculture.
fold change correlation between microarray and qpcr data was always significant.
new insights were obtained on putative mechanisms involved on mandibular prognathism, suggesting that bone/nervous system development might play a role in this phenomenon.
