in addition, we demonstrate that this system can be used to identify specific inhibitors of the egln enzymes.
thus, it is a valuable tool to study hif regulation, and particularly egln biochemistry, in a cellular context.
since the progression of the aforementioned pathologies might be influenced by activation of hif-target genes, development of small molecules with the ability to interfere with the hif-regulatory machinery is of great interest.
as a proof of principle we show that two known egln inhibitors, dimethyloxaloylglycine  and 6-chlor-3-hydroxychinolin-2-carbonic acid-n-carboxymethylamide , have a profound and specific effect on the yeast hif/egln/vhl system.
the system described in this work accurately reconstitutes hif regulation while preserving egln substrate specificity.
in this system, yeast growth, under specific nutrient restrictions, is driven by the interaction between the β domain of vhl and a hydroxyproline-containing hifα peptide.
we propose that this system, in combination with a matched control, can be used as a simple and inexpensive assay to identify molecules that specifically modulate egln activity.
importantly, this system accurately preserves the specificity of the hydroxylation reaction toward specific substrates.
in turn, this interaction is strictly dependent on egln activity that hydroxylates the hifα peptide.
herein we describe a yeast three-hybrid system that reconstitutes mammalian hif regulation by the eglns and vhl.
