in addition, over-representation of particular members of different transcription factor families suggests important roles for these genes in the differentiation of the effective cell separation layer within the many layers contained in the citrus laz.
our analyses of gene functional classes differentially represented in ethylene-treated laz revealed an activation program dominated by the expression of genes associated with protein synthesis, protein fate, cell type differentiation, development and transcription.
therefore, detailed studies at the resolution of cell type are of great relevance in order to accurately describe the process and to identify potential candidate genes for biotechnological applications.
preferential expression of stress-related and defensive genes in pet reveals that this tissue is likely to be reprogrammed to prevent pathogen attacks and general abiotic stresses after organ shedding.
the extensive repertoire of genes associated with cell wall biosynthesis and metabolism strongly suggests that laz layers activate both catabolic and anabolic wall modification pathways during the abscission program.
efficient protocols for the isolation of specific citrus cell types, namely laminar abscission zone  and petiolar cortical  cells based on laser capture microdissection  and for rna microextraction and amplification have been developed.
a comparative transcriptome analysis between laz and pet from citrus leaf explants subjected to an in-vitro  <dig> h ethylene treatment was performed utilising microarray hybridization and analysis.
at the same time, the process itself also constitutes an excellent model to study cell separation processes, since it occurs in concrete areas known as abscission zones  which are composed of a specific cell type.
this study provides novel molecular insight into ethylene-promoted leaf abscission and identifies new putative target genes for characterization and manipulation of organ abscission in citrus.
