we demonstrate a novel role for jnk in wnt-mediated mt stability.
epistatic analyses and pharmacological studies suggest that the wnt-dvl signalling regulates the dynamic of the cytoskeleton through two different pathways that lead to inhibition of gsk3β and activation of jnk in the same cell.
wnt factors are a large family of signaling molecules that play important roles in the regulation of cell fate specification, tissue polarity and cell movement.
wnt-dvl pathway increases mt stability through a transcription independent mechanism that requires the concomitant inhibition of gsk3β and activation of jnk.
here we show that the wnt pathway also activates c-jun n-terminal kinase  to regulate mt stabilization.
although in the wnt planar cell polarity  pathway, jnk lays downstream of rho gtpases, these gtpases are not required for wnt-mediated mts stability.
in the nervous system, wnts also regulates the formation of neuronal connection acting as retrograde signals that regulate the remodeling of the axons prior to the assembly of the presynaptic apparatus.
