microbial communities, ranging from simple to highly diverse, play a crucial role in this process.
if individuals are fixed at lattice sites or direct selection is low, indirect selection result in lineages that structure their local environment, leading to 'smart' individuals and stable patterns of resource dynamics.
on the other hand, if individuals randomly change position each time step, or direct selection is high, individuals are more prone to crossfeeding: an ecosystem based solution with turbulent resource dynamics, and individuals that are less capable of cycling resources themselves.
by varying the strength of indirect selection through the spatial setting and direct selection, the integration of information by the evolutionary process leads to qualitatively different results from individual smartness to cooperative community structures.
we find that the shortest cycle dominates the ecological dynamics, and over evolutionary time its length is minimized.
we study indirect selection by changing the spatial setting and the strength of direct selection.
the evolutionary dynamics that follow are determined by the strength of indirect selection for resource cycling.
the individuals are good at cycling resources themselves and do this with a short cycle.
in this study, our basic questions are how does a community evolve its resource usage and how are resource cycles partitioned?
given a fixed amount of resources, this leads to resource cycles.
in a baseline model of ecosystem evolution we demonstrate different eco-evolutionary trajectories of resource cycling.
