the final predicted ppi network, citrusnet, contained  <dig>  proteins with  <dig>  interactions.
because it is a woody plant with a long growth cycle, genetic studies of sweet orange are lagging behind those of other species.
in addition, we calculated the expression difference of interacting genes  in citrusnet using rna-seq data from four sweet orange tissues, and also analyzed the edi distribution and variation in different sub-networks.
citrusnet provides valuable resources for the study of biological functions in sweet orange.
in this analysis, we employed ortholog identification and domain combination methods to predict the protein-protein interaction  network for sweet orange.
all evidence supported the idea that tor can integrate various hormone signals and affect plant growth.
gene expression in citrusnet has significant modular features.
