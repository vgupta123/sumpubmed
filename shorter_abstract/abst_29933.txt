there is currently no standardized practice or method for validating the properties of a model before placing it in the public domain.
stoichiometric models provide a structural framework for analyzing steady-state cellular behavior.
we present a review of common issues in stoichiometric models typically uncovered during pathway analysis and constraint-based optimization, and we detail succinct and efficient ways to find them.
mc <dig> provides a standalone matlab-based comprehensive tool for model validation, a task currently performed either ad hoc or implemented in part within other computational tools.

we present mc <dig>  model and constraint consistency checker, a computational tool that can be used for two purposes:  identifying potential connectivity and topological issues for a given stoichiometric matrix, s, and  flagging issues that arise during constraint-based optimization.
the first examines the results of computing the basis for the null space for sv = 0; the second uses connectivity analysis; and the third utilizes flux variability analysis.
we report the results of applying mc <dig> to published models for several systems including escherichia coli, an adipocyte cell, a chinese hamster ovary cell, and leishmania major.
mc <dig> takes as input a stoichiometric matrix and flux constraints, and generates a report summarizing issues.
