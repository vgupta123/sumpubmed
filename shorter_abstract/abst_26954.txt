we identify sn or sc biomarkers for tgsss obtained from previous studies of high-grade serous ovarian cancer  and breast cancer .
for each gid in a gss of interest , our method counts the empirical frequency of gid co-occurrences/overlaps in other reference gsss  and compares it with the expected frequency generated via implementation of a randomized sampling procedure.
furthermore, both sc and sn genes, in both signatures could be considered as perspective prognostic biomarkers of bcs that stratify the patients onto low or high risks of cancer development.
our method identifies sn and sc genes of a 36-gene prognostic signature that stratify hg-soc patients into subgroups with low, intermediate or high-risk of the disease outcome.
comparison of the empirical frequency distribution  with the expected background frequency distribution  allows dichotomization of statistically novel  and common  gids within the tgss.
our results indicate that while independently there is little overlap between our tgss with individual rgsss, comparison of the efd with bfd suggests that beyond a confidence threshold, tested gids become more common in rgsss than expected.
practically, our results suggest that there is a stronger association of the igf <dig> signature genes with the  <dig> bc rgsss, than for the obesity-associated signature.
