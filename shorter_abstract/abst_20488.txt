by applying parameter filtering we found a subset of ~ <dig> parameters produced higher prediction ability compared to the full set.
we have developed a software tool, mirpara, that predicts most probable mature mirna coding regions from genome scale sequences in a species specific manner.
mirpara is an effective tool for locating mirnas coding regions in genome sequences and can be used as a screening step prior to hts experiments.
identification of these molecules and their targets can aid understanding of regulatory processes.
our software achieves an accuracy of up to 80% against experimentally verified mature mirnas, making it one of the most accurate methods available.
if sequences are available, computational methods can provide a screening step to investigate the value of an hts study and aid interpretation of results.
we classified sequences from mirbase into animal, plant and overall categories and used a support vector machine to train three models based on an initial set of  <dig> parameters related to the physical properties of the pre-mirna and its mirnas.
micrornas are a family of ~ <dig> nt small rnas that can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
