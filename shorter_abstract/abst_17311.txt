comparisons with the honeybee and other insects allowed the identification of potential candidates for gene loss, pseudogene evolution, and possible incomplete annotation in the honeybee genome.
additionally, the est library provides a resource for the discovery of genetic markers that can be used in population level studies.
indeed, initial screens identified  <dig> simple sequence repeats and  <dig> potential single nucleotide polymorphisms.
the ests provide direct evidence of transcriptionally active regions, but they will also facilitate further functional genomics, gene discovery and future genome annotation.
the resource that these b. terrestris ests represent is valuable for ongoing work.
is a key member of natural pollinator assemblages.
this species is extensively used for commercial pollination in europe, and along with other bombus spp.
the bumblebee, bombus terrestris , is of widespread importance.
furthermore, the species is studied in a wide variety of biological fields.
subsequent clustering resulted in 13' <dig> unique sequences.
although the library is derived from unchallenged bees, we still uncover transcription of a number of immune genes spanning the principally described insect immune pathways.
