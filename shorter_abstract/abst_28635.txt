we totally identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genomic loci harboring  <dig> snps that were significantly associated with ldl-c, tc, tg and the ratio of hdl-c/ldl-c in two experimental populations, respectively.
in the f <dig> population, the most prominent snp was identified at the ssc3:  <dig> ,847 bp where apob is the well-known candidate gene.
however, in the sutai population, the most number of significant snps was identified at ssc2:  <dig> - <dig>  mb where ldlr was identified as the candidate gene.
many of these transcripts correspond to candidate genes for blood lipids in humans.
one gene encoding the transcript gnl|ug|ssc#s <dig> stands out to be an important candidate gene for ldl-c by an integrative analysis of gwas, eqtl and trait-associated expression.
we identified the genomic regions or candidate genes associated with blood lipids by an integrative analysis of gwas, qtt and eqtl mapping in pigs.

serum concentrations of total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  and triglycerides  are highly heritable traits that are used clinically to evaluate risk for cardiovascular disease in humans.
the findings would benefit the further identification of the causative genes for blood lipid traits in both pigs and humans.
in this study, we applied a genome-wide association study  in  <dig>  pigs from two populations and gene expression studies on  <dig> liver samples to dissect the genetic basis of serum lipids in a pig model.
furthermore, we firstly reported  <dig> novel genomic loci in pigs harboring the ldl-c-associated snps.
