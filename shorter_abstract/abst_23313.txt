calculating the mean deviation between imputed values and duplicate controls in five datasets, we show that knn-based imputation gives a systematic bias of the imputed expression values of one-channel depleted spots.
by including more information in the imputation step, we more accurately estimate missing expression values.
evaluating the correction of this bias by cross-validation showed that the mean square deviation between imputed values and duplicates were reduced up to 51%, depending on dataset.
