both smrc and larc development were accompanied by similar temporal expression patterns of candidate regulators, including the transcription factors whib <dig>  whib <dig>  and whib <dig>  which are orthologues of the streptomyces sporulation regulators whib, whid and wbla, respectively.
here, we carried out rna-seq profiling of smrc and larc development to characterize the transcriptional program underlying these starvation-induced differentiation processes.
transcriptional analyses of the development of mycobacterial resting cell types suggest that these bacteria harbor a novel differentiation program and identify a series of potential regulators.
when subjected to starvation conditions, cells of m. smegmatis exit from the canonical cell division cycle, segregate and compact their chromosomes, and become septated and multi-nucleoided.
in the presence of traces of carbon sources this multi-nucleoided cell stage completes cell division and separates into small resting cells .
the observed compaction of chromosomes was accompanied by an increase of the transcript level of the dna binding protein hlp, an orthologue of the streptomyces spore-specific chromosome condensation protein hups.
the formation of multi-nucleoided cells  was accompanied by upregulation of septum formation functions ftsz, ftsw, and pbpb, as well as the dna translocase ftsk.
mycobacteria, along with exospore forming streptomyces, belong to the phylum actinobacteria.
under zero nutrient conditions the differentiation process terminates at this stage with the formation of large resting cells .
