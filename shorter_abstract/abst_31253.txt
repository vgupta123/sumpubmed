a new specimen of manchurochelys manchoukuoensis is described here from the jiufotang formation of qilinshan, chifeng, inner mongolia, china.
and dracochelys bicuspis in the majority of our analyses.
manchurochelys manchoukuoensis is a critical taxon for unraveling the phylogenetic relationships of cretaceous pancryptodires from asia, a group that is considered to be of key importance for the origin of crown-group hidden-neck turtles .
manchurochelys manchoukuoensis was one of the first vertebrates described from this fauna, also known as the jehol biota.
manchurochelys manchoukuoensis is an emblematic turtle from the cretaceous yixian formation of liaoning, china, a geological rock unit that is famous for yielding perfectly preserved skeletons of fossil vertebrates, including that of feathered dinosaurs.
manchurochelys manchoukuoensis nests within sinemydidae together with sinemys spp.
this is the third specimen described and expands the range of this taxon from the yixian formation of the fuxin-yixian basin in liaoning to the jiufotang formation of the chifeng-yuanbaoshan basin.
the inclusion of problematic tree changing taxa, such as panpleurodires  has a major influence on the phylogenetic relationships of sinemydidae and closely allied forms.
