we have demonstrated the superiority and stability of our algorithms by performing comprehensive experimental comparisons with nine state-of-the-art algorithms on six high-dimensional heterogeneous profiles under cross validations.
in addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-resolution independent component analysis in meaningful biomarker discovery, we present a multi-resolution independent component analysis based support vector machines  and linear discriminant analysis  to attain high-performance classifications in low-dimensional spaces.
the multi-resolution data analysis based redundant global feature suppressing and effective local feature extraction also have a positive impact on large scale ‘omics’ data mining.
although high-throughput microarray based molecular diagnostic technologies show a great promise in cancer diagnosis, it is still far from a clinical application due to its low and instable sensitivities and specificities in cancer molecular pattern recognition.
we propose a novel feature selection method: multi-resolution independent component analysis  for large-scale gene expression data.
this method overcomes the weak points of the widely used transform-based feature selection methods such as principal component analysis , independent component analysis , and nonnegative matrix factorization  by avoiding their global feature-selection mechanism.
this work suggests a new direction to accelerate microarray technologies into a clinical routine through building a high-performance classifier to attain clinical-level sensitivities and specificities by treating an input profile as a ‘profile-biomarker’.
our classification algorithms, especially, mica-svm, not only accomplish clinical or near-clinical level sensitivities and specificities, but also show strong performance stability over its peers in classification.
