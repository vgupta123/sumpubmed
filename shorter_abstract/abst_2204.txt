we present evidence that dozens of species-specific snornas that they described in vertebrates are experimental artifacts resulting from the improper use of northern hybridization.
zhu and coworkers, as well as most other groups studying vertebrate snornas, give new names to newly described homologs of human snornas, which significantly complicates comparison between different species.
our results demonstrate that conclusions based only on databases with automatically annotated ncrnas can be erroneous.
the snorna genes with putative intrinsic promoters that were supposed to be transcribed independently proved to contain numerous substitutions and are, most likely, pseudogenes.
thus, the same promoter is used for the transcription of snornas and host genes.
in some cases, they are localized within introns of overlooked host genes.
first, numerous mammalian snorna pseudogenes were considered as genes, whereas most of them are localized outside of host genes and contain substitutions that question their functionality.
second, zhu and coworkers failed to identify many snorna genes in non-mammalian species.
the pattern of rrna modifications and the set of snornas that guide these modifications are conserved in vertebrates.
it seems necessary to develop a uniform nomenclature for homologs of human snornas in other vertebrates, e.g., human gene names prefixed with several-letter code denoting the vertebrate species.
nearly all snorna genes in vertebrates are localized in introns of other genes and are processed from pre-mrnas.
finally, an increased number of snorna genes in mammalian genomes described by zhu and coworkers is also an artifact resulting from two mistakes.
as an illustration, we present  <dig> c/d snorna genes that we have identified and annotated in vertebrates.
