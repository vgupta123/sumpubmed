in this study we investigated whether delayed minocycline inhibits brain mmps activated by ischemia in a model of temporary occlusion in wistar rats.
minocycline is a potential new therapeutic agent to acute treatment of ischemic stroke.
matrix metalloproteinases  <dig> and  <dig>  are increased in the brain after experimental ischemic stroke in rats.
these two proteases are involved with the degradation of the basal lamina and loss of stability of the blood brain barrier that occurs after ischemia and that is associated with thrombolytic therapy in ischemic stroke.
minocycline is a lipophilic tetracycline and is neuroprotective in several models of brain injury.
both mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> were elevated in the ischemic tissue as compared to the contra-lateral hemisphere after  <dig> hours occlusion and  <dig> hours survival .
