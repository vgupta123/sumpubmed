however, it has lacked an efficient loss-of-function method for studies of gene function.
furthermore, the amount of retinal tissue affected can be controlled by manipulating the degree of infection.
this technique provides a rapid and efficient loss-of-function option for studies in the developing chick retina.
the knock down persists as the retina matures and can be detected using in situ hybridization.
