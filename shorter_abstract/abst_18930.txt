contact network models have become increasingly common in epidemiology, but we lack a flexible programming framework for the generation and analysis of epidemiological contact networks and for the simulation of disease transmission through such networks.
epifire provides an open-source programming interface for the rapid development of network models with a focus in contact network epidemiology.
network-based percolation and chain-binomial simulations of susceptible-infected-recovered disease transmission, as well as traditional non-network mass-action simulations, can be performed using epifire.
epifire also provides a point-and-click interface for generating networks, conducting epidemic simulations, and creating figures.
here we present epifire, an applications programming interface and graphical user interface implemented in c++, which includes a fast and efficient library for generating, analyzing and manipulating networks.
