using a light/dark choice paradigm, in which larval zebrafish display an innate dark avoidance behavior , we find that heat, cold and uv stimuli significantly enhance their dark avoidance with heat having the most striking effect, whereas md and si have little influence on the behavior.
the findings that various stressors enhance while anxiolytics attenuate dark avoidance further reinforce that the light/dark preference behavior in larval zebrafish is fear/anxiety-associated.
these stimuli are selected based on their perceived aversive nature to larval zebrafish.
surprisingly, using the cortisol assay, a physiological measure of stress, we uncover that all stimuli but heat and si significantly increase the whole body cortisol levels.
despite these attractive features, there is a scarcity of behavioral characterizations in larval zebrafish compared to other model organisms as well as adult zebrafish.
in this study, we have characterized the physiological and behavioral responses of larval zebrafish to several easily amenable stimuli, including heat, cold, uv, mechanical disturbance , and social isolation .
these results identify a series of stressors that can be easily administered to larval zebrafish.
moreover, their small body size  is compatible with 96-well plates, making larval zebrafish amenable to high content screening.
larval zebrafish, with a simple and transparent vertebrate brain composed of ~100Â k neurons, is well suited for deciphering entire neural circuit activity underlying behavior.
