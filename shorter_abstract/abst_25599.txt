the role of hfq-based regulation has been well defined in gram-negative bacteria, but comparatively less is known about the impact of hfq proteins in gram-positive species.
the increase in hfq <dig> protein levels led to anomalous cell shape and chain formation, which manifested as a severe growth defect.
bacterial hfq proteins post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression, primarily by mediating the interaction between srnas  and their target mrnas.
these results not only aid in elucidating the role of hfq proteins in b. anthracis, but also contribute to our current understanding of hfq in gram-positive bacteria.
thus, we hypothesize that hfq <dig> interacts with rna involved in essential functions in the b. anthracis cell, leading to increased binding upon overexpression that either sequesters or accelerates degradation of rnas important for growth.
toxicity was dependent on residues on the distal face of hfq <dig> that are involved in mrna binding in other bacterial species.
in this study, we utilized overexpression as a strategy to examine the impact of hfq <dig> on b. anthracis physiology.
this phenotype was specific to b. anthracis, as hfq <dig> expression in b. subtilis at similar levels was not toxic.
