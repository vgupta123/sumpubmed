the modified scoring system in this study provides moderate reliability in assessing the functional neurologic status of each pelvic limb, by oga without videotape, in canine t3-l <dig> patients.
without videotape there was only slight agreement , but with videotape there was moderate agreement .
the objective of this study was to develop and assess the reliability of a modified scoring system for evaluating the function of the two pelvic limbs separately, in ambulatory thoracolumbar myelopathy dogs.
a previously established neurologic score scale for dogs with t3-l <dig> lesions was modified in order to provide a separate score for each pelvic limb.
for the decision regarding which pelvic limb was more severely affected, a fair agreement  between the two observers was noted.
seventeen ambulatory dogs with thoracolumbar myelopathies were evaluated.
there was poor agreement  between the two observers for all  <dig> ogas.
