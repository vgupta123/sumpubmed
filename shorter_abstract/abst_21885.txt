restriction-free  cloning, a pcr-based method for the creation of custom dna plasmids, allows for the insertion of any sequence into any plasmid vector at any desired position, independent of restriction sites and/or ligation.
this new method does not require restriction sites or alterations of the plasmid or the gene of interest, or additional treatments.
the amplified fragments were then used as the templates in two separate linear amplification reactions containing either forward or reverse primer to generate two single-strand reverse-complement counterparts, which could anneal to each other.
here, we describe a simple and fast method for performing gene reconstitution by modified rf cloning.

the simplicity of both primer design and the procedure itself makes the method suitable for high-throughput cloning and structural genomics.
the average cloning efficiency was higher than 85%, as confirmed by colony pcr and sequencing of the inserts.
the annealed inserts and acceptors with 5’ and 3’ cohesive ends were sealed by ligation reaction.
our method provides an alternative cloning method capable of inserting any dna fragment of up to at least 20 kb into a plasmid, with high efficiency.
