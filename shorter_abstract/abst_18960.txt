cultivated tetraploid cottons, gossypium hirsutum and g. barbadense, share a common ancestor formed by a merger of the a and d genomes about 1- <dig> million years ago.
a whole genome physical map of g. raimondii, the putative d genome ancestral species of tetraploid cottons was assembled, integrating genetically-anchored overgo hybridization probes, agarose based fingerprints and 'high information content fingerprinting' .
a total of  <dig>  bac-end sequences and  <dig>  dna probes were used in genetically anchoring  <dig> contigs to a cotton consensus genetic map, and  <dig> and  <dig> contigs, respectively to arabidopsis thaliana  and vitis vinifera  whole genome sequences.
toward the long-term goal of characterizing the spectrum of diversity among cotton genomes, the worldwide cotton community has prioritized the d genome progenitor gossypium raimondii for complete sequencing.
much of the gene rich component is aligned to the arabidopsis and vitis vinifera genomes and shows promise for utilizing translational genomic approaches in understanding this important genome and its resident genes.
the integrated genetic-physical map is of value both in assembling and validating a planned reference sequence.
several lines of evidence suggest that the g. raimondii genome is comprised of two qualitatively different components.
genetically anchored physical maps of large eukaryotic genomes have proven useful both for their intrinsic merit and as an adjunct to genome sequencing.
