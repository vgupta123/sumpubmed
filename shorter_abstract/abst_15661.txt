biomedical literature, e.g., medline, contains a wealth of knowledge regarding functions of proteins.
the major and recurring biological concepts within a collection of medline documents can be extracted by the lda model.
the identified topics/concepts were further mapped to the controlled vocabulary of the gene ontology  terms based on mutual information.
the goal of this research is to identify the major biological topics/concepts from a corpus of protein-related medlineÂ© titles and abstracts by applying a probabilistic topic model.
the identified topics/concepts provide parsimonious and semantically-enriched representation of the texts in a semantic space with reduced dimensionality and can be used to index text.
based on the bayesian model selection,  <dig> major topics were extracted from the corpus.
major recurring biological concepts within such text corpora represent the domains of this body of knowledge.
