we applied a graph-based extension of our iterative group analysis  approach to obtain a statistically rigorous identification of the subgraphs of interest in any evidence graph.
we validated the graph-based iterative group analysis  by applying it to the classic yeast diauxic shift experiment of derisi et al., using geneontology and metabolic network information.
giga reliably identified and summarized all the biological processes discussed in the original publication.
giga provides a fast and flexible delimitation of the most interesting areas in a microarray experiment, and leads to a considerable speed-up and improvement of the interpretation process.
metabolic and signaling pathways, protein interaction maps, shared geneontology annotations, or literature co-citation relations.
one of the most time-consuming tasks after performing a gene expression experiment is the biological interpretation of the results by identifying physiologically important associations between the differentially expressed genes.
visualization of the detected subgraphs allowed the convenient exploration of the results.
