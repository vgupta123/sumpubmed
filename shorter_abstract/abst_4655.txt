to characterise further similarities between hazv and cchfv, and support the use of hazv as a model for cchfv infection, we investigated the structure of the hazv nucleocapsid protein  and compared it to cchfv n. n performs an essential role in the viral life cycle by encapsidating the viral rna genome, and thus, n represents a potential therapeutic target.
hazv n has a similar overall structure to cchfv n, with their globular domains superposing with an rmsd =  <dig>  Å, over  <dig> alpha carbons that share  <dig> % sequence identity.
the crystal structure of hazv n reveals a close similarity to cchfv n, supporting the use of hazv as a model for cchfv.
we present the purification, crystallisation and crystal structure of hazv n at  <dig>  Å resolution.
hazv n was expressed as an n-terminal glutathione s-transferase  fusion protein then purified using glutathione affinity chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography.
hazv n crystallised in the p <dig> space group with unit cell parameters a =  <dig> , b =  <dig> , and c =  <dig>  Å. hazv n consists of a globular domain formed mostly of alpha helices derived from both the n- and c-termini, and an arm domain comprising two long alpha helices.
four hazv n monomers crystallised in the asymmetric unit, and their head-to-tail assembly reveals a potential interaction site between monomers.
in contrast hazv is not associated with serious human disease, although infection of interferon receptor knockout mice with either cchfv or hazv results in similar disease progression.
structural similarity between the n proteins should facilitate study of the cchfv and hazv replication cycles without the necessity of working under containment level  <dig>  conditions.
hazara virus  is a member of the bunyaviridae family of segmented negative stranded rna viruses, and shares the same serogroup as crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever virus .
