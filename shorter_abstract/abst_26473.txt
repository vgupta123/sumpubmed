however, at 12Â h after ecdysis, the feeding larvae of 5th instars that were injected with 20-hydroxyecdysone entered a molting-like stage, during which changes in midgut morphology, dna synthesis, gene expression, and microflora exhibited the same patterns as observed in the actual molting state.
during the molting stage, midguts harbor less microflora and dna synthesis decreases.
although the molting larva becomes immobile and quiescent, we demonstrate that numerous changes occur in midgut morphology, physiology, metabolism and microbiome during this period.
molting, a special period during which the old insect cuticle is shed and a new one is produced, is crucial for insect development.
insects can be models for understanding human intestinal infection and pathology.
holometabolous insects may experience several larva-to-larva moltings to become larger, a pupal molt and adult eclosion to become adults.
both ecdysone and juvenile hormone in the larval midgut likely degrade after entering the larva-to-larva molting stage.
