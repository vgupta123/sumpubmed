the notion of a continuous output vector also incorporates the reality of gene networks and graded concentrations of gene products.
the continuous model affords a more complete view of the evolution of interacting genes.
in our model, each network is described by a matrix representing the interactions between transcription factors, and a vector of continuous values representing the transcription factor expression in an individual.
we also show that gene insertion is a very efficient way to add more genes to a network as it provides a much higher chance of developmental stability.
