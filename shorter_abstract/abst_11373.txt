this conditional expression rat model may have application for transgenic overexpression or knockdown studies of gene function in development, disease and gene therapy.
the homozygous rat line  generated by lentiviral vector injection, has a single integration site and was derived from the offspring of a genetic mosaic founder with multiple transgene integrations.
the rtta-m <dig> transgene integrated into an intron of a putative gene on chromosome  <dig> and does not appear to affect the tissue-specificity or expression of that gene.
