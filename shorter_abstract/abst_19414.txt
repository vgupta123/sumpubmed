sequencing of c-kit revealed secondary mutations in the juxtamembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the resistant sublines.
additionally, chronic toc exposure resulted in c-kit mrna and kit protein overexpression in the toc-resistant sublines compared to the parental line.
mutations in the c-kit proto-oncogene are associated with the tumorigenesis of mcts, resulting in growth factor-independent and constitutive phosphorylation of the kit receptor tyrosine kinase .
c <dig>  tr <dig>  tr <dig>  and tr <dig> cells demonstrated minimal p-glycoprotein  activity and no functional p-gp.
these included point mutations in tr <dig> , tr <dig> , and tr <dig> .
interestingly, sensitivity to three structurally distinct kit rtk inhibitors was variable among the sublines, and all  <dig> sublines retained sensitivity to the cytotoxic agents vinblastine and lomustine.
mast cell tumors  are the most common skin tumors in dogs and exhibit variable biologic behavior.
toc inhibited kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in the treatment-na√Øve, parental c <dig> line .
this model may be used to investigate the molecular basis of and strategies to overcome toc resistance.
in contrast, the three sublines were resistant to growth inhibition by toc  and phosphorylation of the kit receptor was less inhibited compared to the toc-sensitive c <dig> cells.
this study demonstrates the development of an in vitro model of acquired resistance to targeted therapy in canine mcts harboring a c-kit-activating mutation.
