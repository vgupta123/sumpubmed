these data help further our understanding of the function and mechanism of various mirnas and their target genes in the molecular pathology of ad.
our results demonstrate ad-specific changes in the mirna regulatory system as well as the relationship between the expression levels of mirnas and their targets in the hippocampus of tg <dig> mice.
for functional validation in primary cultured neurons from tg <dig> mice  and littermate  controls, the overexpression of arrdc <dig> enhanced ppp1r3c expression.
pathological environment created by aβ treatment increased the gene expression of ppp1r3c and sfpq but did not significantly alter the expression of mir139-5p or mir3470a.
we constructed gene regulatory networks and used the pagerank algorithm to predict significant interactions between mirna and mrna.
among these,  <dig> significant mirna-mrna interactions were predicted by integrating sequence target prediction, expression analysis, and the pagerank algorithm.
here, we applied the joint profiling analysis of mrna and mirna expression levels to tg <dig> ad model mice at  <dig> and 8 months of age using a network topology-based method.
we identified a set of mirna-mrna interactions that were changed in the hippocampus of tg <dig> ad model mice.
aβ treatment increased the promoter activity of arrdc <dig> gene in lm primary cells but not in mt primary cells.
we determined the expression levels of several candidate genes and mirna.
sequence-based target prediction algorithms and anti-correlation profiles have been applied to predict mirna targets using omics data, but this approach often leads to false positive predictions.
