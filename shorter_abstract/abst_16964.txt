although many sexually dimorphic traits have been described in s. latifolia, all of them are quantitative, and they usually become apparent only after the initiation of flowering.
among dioecious plants displaying sexual dimorphism, silene latifolia is one of the most studied species.
we describe three ests that show sex-specific  transcription at the rosette stage before the first flowering season.
to our knowledge, this study provides the first molecular evidence of early pre-flowering sexual dimorphism in angiosperms.
we present rt-pcr-based evidence that in s. latifolia, sexual dimorphism in gene expression is present long before the initiation of flowering.
