we have documented an expansion in the amoebozoa of a family of inactive myotubularins with a novel domain architecture, which we dub "imlrk" .
inactive myotubularin homologues with distinct domain architectures appear to have arisen on three separate occasions in different eukaryotic lineages.
we have mapped domain architecture, and inferred evolutionary histories.
there is an especially large myotubularin gene family in the pathogen entamoeba histolytica, the majority of them imlrk proteins.
the large and distinctive set of myotubularin genes found in an important pathogen species suggest that in this organism myotubularins might present important new targets for basic research and perhaps novel therapeutic strategies.
we have analyzed published patterns of gene expression in this organism which indicate that myotubularins may be important to critical life cycle stage transitions and host infection.
