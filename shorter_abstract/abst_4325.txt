to better understand the homology of chameleon carpal and tarsal elements, the process of syndactyly, cleft formation, and how modification of the mesopodial skeleton has played a role in the evolution and diversification of chameleons, we have studied the veiled chameleon .
phylogenetically derived chameleons exhibit a ‘typical’ outgroup complement of mesopodial elements , with twice the number of currently recognized carpal and tarsal elements considered for this clade.
our study uncovered a previously underappreciated degree of mesopodial skeletal diversity in chameleons.
we analysed limb patterning and morphogenesis through in situ hybridization, in vitro whole embryo culture and pharmacological perturbation, scoring for apoptosis, clefting, and skeletogenesis.
body size may have played a role in the characteristic mesopodial skeletal architecture of chameleons by constraining deployment of the skeletogenic program in the smaller and earliest diverged and basal taxa.
our study challenges the ‘re-evolution’ of osteological features by showing that ‘re-evolving’ a ‘lost’ feature de novo  may instead be due to so called ‘missing structures’ being present but underdeveloped and/or fused to other adjacent elements  whose independence may be re-established under changes in adaptive selective pressure.
interdigital cell death therefore may be an ancestral characteristic of the autopodium, however syndactyly is an evolutionary novelty.
one of the most distinctive traits found within chamaeleonidae is their split/cleft autopodia and the simplified and divergent morphology of the mesopodial skeleton.
