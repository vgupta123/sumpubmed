in the large-scale benchmark calculation consisting of  <dig> known hiv epitopes covering all  <dig> recognized hla supertypes, the netctl- <dig>  method was shown to have a sensitivity among the 5% top-scoring peptides above  <dig> .
netctl- <dig>  is demonstrated to have a higher predictive performance than epijen, mappp, mhc-pathway, and wapp on all performance measures.
in order to compare the performance of prediction methods, objective benchmarks and standardized performance measures are needed.
here, we develop such large-scale benchmark and corresponding performance measures and report the performance of an updated version  <dig>  of netctl in comparison with the four other methods.
we define a number of performance measures that can handle the different types of output data from the five methods.
netctl is a web-based tool designed for predicting human ctl epitopes in any given protein.
at least four other methods have been developed recently that likewise attempt to predict ctl epitopes: epijen, mappp, mhc-pathway, and wapp.
we use two evaluation datasets consisting of known hiv ctl epitopes and their source proteins.
it does so by integrating predictions of proteasomal cleavage, tap transport efficiency, and mhc class i affinity.
most importantly, they can minimize the experimental effort needed to identify epitopes.
reliable predictions of cytotoxic t lymphocyte  epitopes are essential for rational vaccine design.
the source proteins are split into all possible  <dig> mers and except for annotated epitopes; all other  <dig> mers are considered non-epitopes.
in another measure, we find the specificity of the methods at three predefined sensitivity values.
lastly, for each method, we calculate the percentage of known epitopes that rank within the 5% peptides with the highest predicted score.
in the rank measure, we compare two methods at a time and count how often each of the methods rank the epitope highest.
