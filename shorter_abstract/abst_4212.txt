little is known about the presence of daysleeper orthologs in other species, or how and when it was domesticated.
we studied the presence of daysleeper orthologs in plants and propose a model for the domestication of the ancestral daysleeper gene in angiosperms.
most species contain more than one sleeper gene.
although sleeper genes are structurally conserved between species, constructs with sleeper genes from grapevine and rice did not complement the daysleeper phenotype in arabidopsis, when expressed under control of the daysleeper promoter.
evidence is also presented for more recent retroposition events of sleeper genes, such as an event in the rice genome, which gave rise to the ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> genes.
we propose the ancestral sleeper gene was formed after a process of retro-transposition during the evolution of the first angiosperms.
it may have acquired an important function early on, as mutation of two sleeper genes in rice, like the daysleeper mutant in a. thaliana gave a developmental phenotype indicative of their importance for normal plant development.
basal angiosperms as well as grasses  and dicotyledonous plants possess such putative orthologous genes, but sleeper-family genes were not found in gymnosperms, mosses and algae.
rice plant lines with an insertion in the ricesleeper <dig> or  <dig> locus displayed phenotypic abnormalities, indicating that these genes are functional and important for normal development in rice.
however these constructs did cause a dominant phenotype when expressed in arabidopsis.
daysleeper encodes a domesticated transposase from the hat-superfamily, which is essential for development in arabidopsis thaliana.
all sleepers contain a c2h <dig> type bed-zinc finger domain and a hatc dimerization domain.
we designated  <dig> motifs, partly overlapping the bed-zinc finger and dimerization domain, which are hallmark features in the sleeper family.
