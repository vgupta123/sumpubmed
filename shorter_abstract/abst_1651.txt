here, we used gene expression profiling to conduct a global study of the cellular processes affected by sirna mediated knockdown of fas in mda-mb- <dig> mammary carcinoma cells.
inhibition of tumor fas causes both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, indicating fas is a promising target for cancer treatment.
these changes were coupled with up-regulation in genes involved in cell cycle arrest and death receptor mediated apoptotic pathways.
quantitative pathway analysis using gene set enrichment analysis software further revealed that the most pronounced effect of fas knockdown was down-regulation in pathways that regulate lipid metabolism, glycolysis, the tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase  is up-regulated in a wide variety of cancers, and is considered a potential metabolic oncogene by virtue of its ability to enhance tumor cell survival.
together these findings reveal a wide network of pathways that are influenced in response to fas knockdown and provide new insight into the role of this enzyme in tumor cell survival and proliferation.
these genes regulate several aspects of tumor function, including metabolism, cell survival/proliferation, dna replication/transcription, and protein degradation.
