the comprehensive physical map of the sheep mhc class i region enhances our understanding of the genetic architecture of the class i mhc region in sheep and will facilitate future studies of mhc function.
chori bacterial artificial chromosomes  known to contain sequences from the sheep mhc class i region were sub-cloned, and the clones partially sequenced.
the low resolution mhc class i physical map was then compared to the cattle reference genome, the chinese merino sheep mhc map published by gao, et al.
the revised map is more similar to bovidae maps than the previous sheep maps and also includes several genes previously not annotated in the chinese merino bac assembly and others not currently annotated in the sheep reference chromosome  <dig>  in particular, the organisation of nonclassical mhc class i genes is similar to that present in the cattle mhc.
sequence analysis and prediction of amino acid sequences of mhc class i classical and nonclassical genes was performed and it was observed that the map contained one classical and eight nonclassical genes together with three possible pseudogenes.

immune related class i genes are clustered into  <dig> blocks; beta, kappa and a novel block not previously identified in other organisms.
the major histocompatibility complex  is a chromosomal region that regulates immune responsiveness in vertebrates.
