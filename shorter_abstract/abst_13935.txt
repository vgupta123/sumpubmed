simulation results show that the dual applications method is reliable even when the error rate is high and Î¸ is low.
in studies of natural populations where the sequencing coverage is usually modest , the dual applications method on pooled samples should be a reasonable choice.
as the error rate is high and the distribution of errors across sites is non-uniform in next generation sequencing  data, it has been a challenge to estimate dna polymorphism  accurately from ngs data.
under the current ngs error rate, sequencing each individual separately offers little advantage unless the coverage per individual is high .
