most constructs showed expression levels even higher than the sv <dig> control and on average a more than two-fold increase at lower temperature.
here we report about the successful identification of an endogenous highly active gene promoter obtained from cho cells which shows conditionally inducible gene expression at reduced temperature.
various constructs were investigated for promoter activity at 37°c and 33°c in transient luciferase reporter gene assays.
this novel cho promoter permits conditionally high-level gene expression.
additionally, production of toxic proteins becomes feasible, since cell metabolism and gene expression do not directly interfere.
this property is of particular advantage for a process with reduced expression during initial cell growth followed by the production phase at low temperature with a boost in expression.
upon a shift to 33°c, a two to three-fold increase of basal productivity  is achieved.
the chinese hamster ovary  expression system is the leading production platform for manufacturing biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of numerous human diseases.
the cho s100a <dig> promoter can be characterized as cold-shock responsive with the potential for improving process performance of mammalian expression systems.
we identified the core promoter sequence  comprising two sp <dig> sites and could show a further increase in activity by duplication of this minimal sequence.
