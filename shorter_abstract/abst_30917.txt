the resulting gene set contains numerous errors in even the most basic form of annotation: the primary structure of the proteins.
we discover non-annotated genes, correct protein boundaries, remove spuriously annotated orfs, and make major advances towards accurate identification of signal peptides.
along with the improved gene models we discover new, more accurate means of identifying signal peptides in proteomics data.
finally, we apply our data to  <dig> other yersinia genomes, correcting and enhancing their annotations.
in total,  <dig> gene models were altered and have been updated in refseq and genbank, which can be accessed seamlessly through any ncbi tool  or downloaded directly.
the application of experimental proteomics data to genome annotation, called proteogenomics, can quickly and efficiently discover misannotations, yielding a more accurate and complete genome annotation.
with the widespread adoption of new sequencing technologies, genome sequences are generated at a near exponential rate, diminishing the time and effort that can be invested in genome annotation.
we present a comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of the plague bacterium, yersinia pestis kim.
