through large taxon sampling and the use of a phylogenetic algorithm designed for inferring evolutionary events in highly divergent paralogs, we obtained a robust, parsimonious and more refined phylogenetic history of the reca/rad <dig> superfamily.
to date, efforts to resolve the deep evolutionary origins of this ancient protein family have been hindered by the high sequence divergence between paralogous groups .
the reca/rad <dig> gene family encodes a diverse set of recombinase proteins that affect homologous recombination, dna-repair, and genome stability.
