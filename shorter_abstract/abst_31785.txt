because of altered cellular and hemodynamic factors, venule segments present a less stringent vascular bed  than that of the bbb.
this artificial brain vascular system is comprised of a bbb module serially connected to a venule segment.
the unique characteristics afforded by the div-bbb in combination with a venule segment will realistically expand our ability to dissect and study the physiological and functional behavior of distinct segments of the human cerebrovascular network.
the perfusate of the capillary module achieves levels of shear stress, pressure, and flow rate comparable to what observed in situ.
the venule module, which attempted to reproduce features of the hemodynamic microenvironment of venules, was perfused by media resulting in shear stress and intraluminal pressure levels lower than those found in capillaries.

abluminal human brain vascular smooth muscle cells were used to reproduce the venular abluminal cell composition.
endothelial cell exposure to flow and abluminal astrocytic stimuli allowed for the formation of a highly selective capillary bbb with a trans-endothelial electrical resistance  and sucrose permeability  comparable to in vivo.
using hollow fiber technology, we modified an existing dynamic artificial model of the bloodâ€“brain barrier   to encompass the distal post-capillary  segments of the brain circulatory system.
