tk-sp was observed to maintain its proteolytic activity with nonionic surfactants and edta at 80Â°c.
it has been known that the hyper-stable protease, tk-sp, could exhibit enzymatic activity even at high temperature and in the presence of chemical denaturants.
in this work, the enzymatic activity of tk-sp was measured in the presence of detergents and edta.
we optimized the condition in which tk-sp functions efficiently, and demonstrated that the enzyme is highly stable in the presence of  <dig> %  nonionic surfactants and  <dig> %  edta, retaining up to 80% of its activity.
our results indicate that tk-sp has a great potential for technological applications, such as thermo-stable detergent additives.
tk-sp is a member of subtilisin-like serine proteases from a hyperthermophilic archaeon thermococcus kodakarensis.
additionally, we also found that tk-sp can degrade prpsc to a level undetectable by western-blot analysis.
