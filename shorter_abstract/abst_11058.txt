the effect of population density on reproduction was negative, mediated by direct negative effects on the proportion of breeders in autumn and winter during outbreak years and by a delayed negative effect on litter size the following year.
we performed a detailed analysis of common vole  reproduction in a cyclic population using a spatially extensive data set over 17Â years in central-western france.
cyclic rodent population dynamics are subjected to both intrinsic regulatory processes such as density-dependence and extrinsic environmental forcing.
in rodents, these processes have been studied mostly independently and their relative importance for population dynamics is poorly known.
environmental seasonality was the main source of explained variation in common vole reproduction.
in particular, we detected a strong impact of plant productivity on fecundity during the breeding season, with low vegetation productivity being able to bring vole reproduction nearly to a halt.
during fall and winter, variability of female vole reproduction is mainly controlled by intrinsic factors, with high population density suppressing reproduction.
during the main breeding season, variability of female vole reproduction is predominantly shaped by food resources, suggesting that only highly productive environment may induce vole outbreaks.
in contrast, vole reproduction during autumn and winter was mainly shaped by intrinsic factors, with only the longer and heavier females being able to reproduce.
