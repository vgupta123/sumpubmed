in order to identify novel 3d motifs that may be associated with molecular functions, we employ an unsupervised, two-phase clustering approach that combines k-means and hierarchical clustering with knowledge-informed cluster selection and annotation methods.
detailed annotation results are available online for all  <dig> clusters at http://feature.stanford.edu/clustering/cys.
the emergence of structural genomics presents significant challenges in the annotation of biologically uncharacterized proteins.
the use of microenvironments instead of backbone geometric criteria enables flexible exploration of protein function space, and detection of recurring motifs that are discontinuous in sequence and diverse in structure.
