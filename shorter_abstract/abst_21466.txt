a number of biochemical methods including cation- and anion-exchange chromatography were evaluated to enrich the cytotoxin from a cell lysate of a known cytotoxin-producing c. jejuni, c <dig>  the cytotoxin in crude lysate was initially prepared by size-exclusion desalting and then subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography  ion-exchange fractionation.
the proteins of pool b were identified by mass spectrometry  after separation by sds-page and trypsin digestion.
eighteen non-cytoplasmic proteins including  <dig> major antigenic peptide proteins  and  <dig> proteins of unknown function were also identified in the screen.
the pool b fraction also induced fluid accumulation in the adult rabbit ileal loop assay with cytotoxicity for mucosa confirming the presence of the cytotoxin.
we report the enrichment and partial purification of c. jejuni cytotoxin by hplc ion-exchange chromatography.
a short-list of six candidate cytotoxin proteins was identified using an lcms screen of pool b. successful isolation of the cytotoxin will initiate steps for the determination of the role of this cytotoxin in the pathogenesis of c. jejuni diarrhoea.
one or more additional cytotoxins other than cdt, including a chinese hamster ovary  cell active, vero cell inactive cytotoxin, may mediate inflammatory diarrhoea.
the cytotoxic activity was heat-stable to 50°c, and partially inactivated at 60-70°c.
also, pool b was directly digested with trypsin and then subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  analysis for identification of lesser abundant proteins in the fraction.
one pooled fraction  was cytotoxic for cho cells equivalent to crude toxin .
campylobater jejuni, a major foodborne diarrhoeal pathogen is reported to produce a number of cytotoxins of which only a cytolethal distending toxin  has been characterised so far.
