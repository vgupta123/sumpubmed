we confirmed approximately  <dig> bp products digested by dicer, and investigated the function of this cloned gene and its involvement in htert expression by transfecting the hepatoma cell lines with full-length dsrna, gene-specific designed sirna, and shrna-generating plasmid.
interestingly, rgm <dig> dsrna, sirna, and shrna inhibited more than 80% of htert mrna expression.
in contrast, primary cultured cells overexpressing the gene showed no significant change in htert mrna expression; the overexpression of the gene strongly suppressed htert mrna in poorly differentiated cells.
rgm <dig> showed cancer-dominant intense expression similar to htert in cancer cell lines, whereas very weak expression was evident in human primary hepatocytes without telomerase activity.
we attempted to clone candidate genes on 10p14â€“ <dig> which may regulate htert expression, through exon trapping using  <dig> bac clones covering the region.
