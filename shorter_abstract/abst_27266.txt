structural genomic projects are beginning to produce protein structures with unknown functions.
identifying the location of binding sites on proteins is of fundamental importance for a wide range of applications including molecular docking, de novo drug design, structure identification and comparison of functional sites.
our approach consists of three steps: local sequence alignment, protein surface detection, and 3d structures comparison.
therefore, efficient methods are required if all these structures are to be properly annotated.
our program has much higher recall values than those existing programs.
experiments show that all the existing approaches have recall values less than 50%.
when comparing a complete protein with all complete protein structures in the pdb database, experiments show that the average recall value of our approach is 82% and the average precision value of our approach is also significantly better than the existing approaches.
here we design a method to find protein binding sites by direct comparison of protein 3d structures.
