in general, the construction of trees is based on sequence alignments.
this procedure, however, leads to loss of informationwhen parts of sequence alignments  are deleted before tree building.
the extensive tests on hiv/siv subtyping showed that the virus classifications produced by our method are in good agreement with our best taxonomic knowledge, even in non-coding ltr  regions that are not tractable by regular alignment methods due to frequent duplications/insertions/deletions.
