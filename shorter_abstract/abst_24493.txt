the curatable abstracts were subsequently manually classified into categories corresponding to different disease domains.
next, using a non-hierarchical and a hierarchical application of svm classifiers trained on  <dig>  curatable abstracts manually classified into three levels of disease specific categories we demonstrated that a hierarchical application of svm classifiers outperformed non-hierarchical svm classifiers for categorization.
in the past, abstracts of scientific articles were retrieved by broad keyword queries of pubmed, and were classified as relevant  or irrelevant  to the scope of the database by a naïve bayes classifier.
utilizing  <dig>  abstracts classified by a domain expert as curatable or uncuratable, we found that a svm classifier outperformed the previously used naïve bayes classifier for curatability predictions with an auc of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
a hierarchical application of svm algorithms with cost sensitive output weighting enabled high quality reference classification with few serious misclassifications.
finally, to optimize the hierarchical svm classifiers' error profile for the curation process, cost sensitivity functions were developed to avoid serious misclassifications.
we tested our design on a benchmark dataset of  <dig>  references and achieved an overall category prediction accuracy of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % at the three levels of categorization, respectively.
