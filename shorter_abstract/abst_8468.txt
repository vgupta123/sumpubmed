hospital medical records was transformed to event sequences, to which filters were applied to extract feature sets capturing diversity in temporal scales and data types.
for unplanned readmissions, auto-extracted feature set using socio-demographic information and medical records, outperformed baselines derived from the socio-demographic information and elixhauser comorbidities, over  <dig> settings .
the advantages of auto-extracted standard features from complex medical records, in a disease and task agnostic manner were demonstrated.
the prediction model was through logistic regression with elastic net regularization.
we contrast auto-extracted features to baselines generated from the elixhauser comorbidities.
the features were evaluated on a readmission prediction task, comparing with baseline feature sets generated from the elixhauser comorbidities.
predictions horizons of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  12Â months were considered for four diverse diseases: diabetes, copd, mental disorders and pneumonia, with derivation and validation cohorts defined on non-overlapping data-collection periods.
