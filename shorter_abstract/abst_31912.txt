transcriptional profiles suggest that lilliputian and suppressor of triplolethal are obligatory cofactors in the adult and that they can also function with cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> at a subset of loci.
following relatively long initiation and promoter clearance, rna polymerase ii can pause and then rapidly elongate following recruitment of positive elongation factors.
our results suggest that transcriptional elongation control is especially important for rapidly expressed genes to support digestion and metabolism, many of which have sex-biased function.
multiple elongation complexes exist, but the role of specific components in adult drosophila is underexplored.
genes showing reduced expression due to these rnai treatments were short and enriched for genes encoding metabolic or enzymatic functions.
transcriptional elongation is a generic function, but is also regulated to allow rapid transcription responses.
expression profiles following lilliputian and suppressor of triplolethal rnai were nearly identical raising the possibility that they are obligatory co-factors.
the dominant-negative cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> profiles showed both overlapping and specific differential expression, suggesting involvement in multiple complexes.
we also observed hundreds of genes with sex-biased differential expression following treatment.
