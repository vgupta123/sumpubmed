as the number of parameters to reproduce physiological functions tend to be large in pbpk models, efficient parameter estimation methods are essential.
after improvements in the original cnm algorithm to maintain parameter diversities, a feasible solution space was successfully estimated for  <dig> or  <dig> parameters in the irinotecan pbpk model, within ten iterations,  <dig> virtual samples, and in  <dig> minutes .

control parameters or parameter correlations were clarified after the parameter estimation processes.
to facilitate new drug development, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic  modeling methods receive growing attention as a tool to fully understand and predict complex pharmacokinetic phenomena.
we have successfully applied a recently developed algorithm to estimate a feasible solution space, called cluster newton method , to reveal the cause of irinotecan pharmacokinetic alterations in two cancer patient groups.
application of cnm achieved a feasible solution space by solving inverse problems of a system containing ordinary differential equations .
