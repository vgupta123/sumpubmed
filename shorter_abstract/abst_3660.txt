these functional attributes were shared between zebrafish and human Δnp <dig> orthologs ectopically expressed in zebrafish embryos.
the functional consequences of coexpression of the different p <dig> isoforms are poorly defined.
both alternative n-terminal p <dig> isoforms were expressed in developing zebrafish in response to cell stress and antagonized lethal effects of flp <dig> to different degrees.
we cloned the zebrafish Δnp <dig> isoform and determined that ionizing radiation increased expression of steady-state Δnp <dig> and Δ113p <dig> mrna levels in zebrafish embryos.
ectopic Δnp <dig> expression by mrna injection caused hypoplasia and malformation of the head, eyes and somites, yet partially counteracted lethal effects caused by concomitant expression of flp <dig>  flp <dig> expression was required for developmental aberrations caused by Δnp <dig> and for Δnp53-dependent expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a .
