in order to process this large amount of information, systems biology shows that a central role is played by regulatory networks composed of genes and proteins.
using standard mathematics and numerical simulations, we explain the types of responses exhibited by the iffl with respect to a train of periodic pulses.
the objective of this paper is to present and to discuss simple regulatory network motifs having the property to maximize their responses under time-periodic stimulations.
we present several simple motif designs of molecular networks producing optimal output in response to periodic stimulations of the system.
we took a look at basic network motifs studied in the literature such as the incoherent feedforward loop  or the interlerlocked negative feedback loop.
moreover we show that these designs can be studied in different contexts of molecular biology, as for example in genetic networks or in signaling pathways.
finally we study the interlerlocked negative feedback loop, i.e.
in elucidating the mechanisms underlying these responses through simple networks the goal is to pinpoint general principles which optimize the oscillatory responses of molecular networks.
a 2-gene motif forming a loop where the nodes respectively activate and repress each other, and show situations where this system possesses a resonance under periodic stimulation.
we show that this system has a non-vanishing response only if the inter-pulse interval is above a threshold.
the identified mechanisms are simple and based on known network motifs in the literature, so that that they could be embodied in existing organisms, or easily implementable by means of synthetic biology.
we next show a mechanism by which average of oscillatory response can be maximized by bursting temporal patterns.
