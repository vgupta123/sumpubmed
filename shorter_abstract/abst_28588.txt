mdivi- <dig> pretreatment significantly reduced seizure activity and increased survival rates of ka-treated mice.
mitochondrial morphology is disrupted during ka-induced seizures; however, it is not clear whether mitochondrial fission or fusion factors are involved in ka-induced neuronal death.
we investigated the effect of mdivi- <dig>  a chemical inhibitor of the mitochondrial fission protein drp <dig>  on mitochondrial morphology and function in ka-injected mice.
we conclude that inhibition of mitochondrial fission attenuates parkin-mediated mitochondrial degradation and protects from ka-induced hippocampal neuronal cell death.

kainic acid -induced excitotoxicity promotes cytoplasmic calcium accumulation, oxidative stress, and apoptotic signaling, leading to hippocampal neuronal death.
mdivi- <dig> was protective against mitochondrial morphological disruption, and it reduced levels of phosphorylated drp <dig>  and parkin recruitment to mitochondria.
mitochondria play a critical role in neuroinflammation and the oxidative stress response.
