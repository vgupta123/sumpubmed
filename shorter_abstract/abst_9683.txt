one intriguing but untested idea is that sleep has evolved by playing an important role in protecting animals from parasitic infection.
these relationships suggest that parasite resistance has played an important role in the evolution of mammalian sleep.
we found that evolutionary increases in mammalian sleep durations are strongly associated with an enhancement of immune defences as measured by the number of immune cells circulating in peripheral blood.
importantly, no comparable relationships occur in related physiological systems that do not serve an immune function.
consistent with an influence of sleep on immune investment, mammalian species that sleep for longer periods also had substantially reduced levels of parasitic infection.
these results are neither predicted nor explained by conventional theories of sleep evolution, and suggest that sleep has a much wider role in disease resistance than is currently appreciated.
species that have evolved longer sleep durations appear to be able to increase investment in their immune systems and be better protected from parasites.
this theory stems, in part, from clinical observations of intimate physiological links between sleep and the immune system.
here, we test this hypothesis by conducting comparative analyses of mammalian sleep, immune system parameters, and parasitism.
