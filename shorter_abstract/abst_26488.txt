the informative est dataset we developed constitutes a much-needed resource for discovery of genes involved in various biological processes in phalaenopsis and other orchid species.
these transcribed sequences will narrow the gap between study of model organisms with many genomic resources and species that are important for ecological and evolutionary studies.
orchids are one of the most diversified angiosperms, but few genomic resources are available for these non-model plants.
among these annotations, over  <dig> unigenes encoding putative transcription factors were identified.
based on sequence similarity with known proteins, these analyses identified  <dig>  different genes .
we aimed to use massively parallel  <dig> pyrosequencing for a global characterization of the phalaenopsis transcriptome.
assembled sequences were annotated with gene ontology, gene family and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways.
