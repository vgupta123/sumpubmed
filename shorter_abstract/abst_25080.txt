the admixture program is commonly used to infer individual ancestry from genomic data.
a number of large genomic datasets are being generated for studies of human ancestry and diseases.
these modifications make admixture more efficient and versatile, allowing users to extract more information from large genomic datasets.
the first enables admixture to infer ancestry for a new set of individuals using cluster allele frequencies from a reference set of individuals.
this mode also allows admixture to correctly estimate individual ancestry and allele frequencies from a set of related individuals.
using data from the  <dig> genomes project, we show that this allows admixture to infer ancestry for  <dig>  individuals in a few hours .
