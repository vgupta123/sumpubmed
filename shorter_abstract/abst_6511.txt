under favorable conditions, hsf- <dig> is inhibited by crowding pheromone-sensitive guanylate cyclase/cgmp  and systemic nutrient-sensing insulin/igf- <dig>  signaling; loss of hsf- <dig> activity allows daf- <dig> to promote reproductive growth.
furthermore, hsf- <dig> upregulates another tgf-β pathway-interacting gene, daf-9/cytochrome p <dig>  thereby fine-tuning the decision between normal growth and dauer formation.
we demonstrate here that in caenorhabditis elegans hsf- <dig> represses the expression of daf- <dig> encoding a tgf-β  ligand, to induce young larvae to enter the dauer stage, a developmentally arrested, non-feeding, highly stress-resistant, long-lived larval form triggered by crowding and starvation.
together, these results provide mechanistic insight into how temperature, nutrient availability and population density coordinately influence development, lifespan, behavior and stress response through hsf- <dig>
however, the mechanisms by which hsf- <dig> adjusts fundamental cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation and aging to the ambient temperature remain largely unknown.
heat shock factor- <dig>  functions as a major player in this response as it activates the transcription of genes coding for molecular chaperones  that maintain structural integrity of proteins.
