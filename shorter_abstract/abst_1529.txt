unlike other snp genotyping methods used to investigate thousands of snps in a few genotypes, or a few snps in around a thousand genotypes, the snplex genotyping system represents a good compromise to investigate several hundred snps in a hundred or more samples simultaneously.
this approach combines robust snp detection with automated assay readout and data analysis.
therefore, the use of the snplex assay, coupled with whole genome amplification , is a good solution for future applications in well-equipped laboratories.
however, following completion of the sequence of the highly heterozygous genome of pinot noir, it has been possible to identify millions of electronic snps  thus providing a valuable source for high-throughput genotyping methods.
<dig> candidate esnps were developed from non-repetitive contigs of the assembled genome of pinot noir and tested in  <dig> progeny of syrah Ã— pinot noir cross.
until recently, only a small number of low- and mid-throughput methods have been used for single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery and genotyping in grapevine .
the efficiency rate of 69% was enhanced to 80% when multiple displacement amplification  methods were used for preparation of genomic dna for the snplex assay.
