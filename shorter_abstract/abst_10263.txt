the variation block method identified recurring recombination blocks accurately and successfully represented block-level diversities in the publicly available genomes of  <dig> soybean and  <dig> rice accessions.
the practicality of this approach was demonstrated by the identification of a putative locus determining soybean hilum color.
the first step is to detect variations by comparing the short-read dna sequences of the cultivar to the reference genome of the target crop.
we propose the variation block method, which is a three-step process for recombination block detection and comparison.
we suggest that the variation block method is an efficient genomics method for the recombination block-level comparison of crop genomes.
next, sequence blocks with variation patterns are examined and defined.
the boundaries between the variation-containing sequence blocks are regarded as recombination sites.
in contrast with wild species, cultivated crop genomes consist of reshuffled recombination blocks, which occurred by crossing and selection processes.
all the assumed recombination sites in the cultivar set are used to split the genomes, and the resulting sequence regions are termed variation blocks.
