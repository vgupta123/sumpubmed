their proportion in each proteome is strongly influenced by genomic base compositional bias.
although ssps are a minority, the genomic forces of base compositional bias and duplications influence their growth and pattern in each species.
in most species simple duplications is favoured, but in a few cases such as mycobacteria, large families of duplications occur.
the preferences and abundance of amino acids are governed by low biosynthetic cost, evolutionary age and base composition of codons.
ssps exhibit preferential association with cell surface, cell membrane and transport functions and a negative association with metabolism.
ssps preferentially associate with cell surface and interface functions as opposed to metabolism, wherein proteins of high sequence complexity with globular structures are preferred.
abundance of charged amino acids arginine and aspartic acid is severely restricted.
arginine is abundant in ssps of two species and in the non-ssps of xanthomonas oryzae.
this relationship is exhibited across species varying in genomic gc, mutational bias, life style, and pathogenicity.
in ssps and in non-ssps, alanine, glycine, leucine, and valine are abundant in species widely varying in genomic gc whereas isoleucine and lysine are rich only in organisms with low genomic gc.
asparagine is abundant only in ssps of low gc species.
ssps are also an important source of genetic and possibly phenotypic variation.
ssps are a minority but they grow with proteome size.
the structural and functional features associated with simple sequence proteins  are non-globularity, disease states, signaling and post-translational modification.
aspartic acid is abundant only in the non-ssps of halobacterium sp nrc <dig>  the abundance of serine in ssps of  <dig> species extends over a broader range compared to that of non-ssps.
