in order to preserve the efficacy of β-lactam antibiotics, culture and susceptibility data should guide therapy and surveillance studies for β-lactamase-producers in developing countries should be launched.
we screened for major β-lactamase phenotypes and diversity of bla genes among  <dig> e. coli strains isolated from clinical samples obtained between  <dig> and  <dig> from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients.
the phenotypes and diversity of bla genes in e. coli strains implicated in clinical infections in non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients in kenya is worryingly high.
although β-lactam antibiotics are heavily used in many developing countries, the diversity of β-lactamase genes  is poorly understood.
majority of isolates producing a combination of ctx-m-15 + oxa-1 + tem- <dig> exhibited resistance phenotypes barely indistinguishable from those of cmt-producers.
on the contrary, 55% isolates from stool exhibited the relatively more susceptible nsbl-like phenotype.
all the phenotypes, and majority of the bla genes, were detected both in isolates from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients but complex phenotypes were particularly common among strains obtained between  <dig> and  <dig> from urine of hospitalized patients.
isolates from urine accounted for 53%, 53%, 74% and 72% of strains exhibiting complex phenotypes such as irt, esbl, cmt or pampc respectively.
