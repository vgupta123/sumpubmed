the coexistence of rh <dig> and amt in prokaryotes seems also a rare event.
the observed hgt events between archaeal methanogens, anaerobic and aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria suggest that syntrophic relationships play a major role in the structuring of the network, and point to oxygen minimum zones as an ecological niche that might be of crucial importance for hgt-driven evolution.

rh <dig> proteins belong to the family of ammonia permeases together with their amt/mep homologs.
ammonia permeases increase the permeability of nh3/nh4
the evolutionary history of rh <dig> genes in prokaryotes is just beginning to be unveiled.
+ across cell membranes and are believed to be involved in excretion of toxic ammonia and in the maintenance of ph homeostasis.
finally, phylogenetic analyses were used to reconstruct the hgt network along which prokaryotic rh <dig> evolution has taken place.
rh <dig> genes are widespread in eukaryotes but absent in land plants and fungi, and remarkably rare in prokaryotes.
