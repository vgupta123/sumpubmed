further, it investigates the suitability of different methods to estimate viral diversity in metagenomes.
up to a saturation point, illumina platforms proved more capable of reconstructing large portions of viral genomes compared to  <dig>  read length was an important factor for limiting chimericity, while scaffolding marginally improved contig length and accuracy.
viruses have unique properties, small genome and regions of high similarity, whose effects on metagenomic assemblies have not been characterized so far.
the genome length of the various viruses in the metagenomes did not significantly affect genome reconstruction, but the co-existence of highly similar genomes was detrimental.
when evaluating diversity estimation tools, we found that phaccs results were more accurate than those from catchall and clustering, which were both orders of magnitude above expected.
despite the high coverage possible, scientists should not expect to always obtain complete genomes, because their reconstruction may be hindered by co-existing species bearing highly similar genomic regions.
the clc assembler revealed subpar compared to idba_ud and camera , which are metagenomic-specific.
while none of the three methods tested had absolute precision, only phaccs was deemed suitable for comparative studies.
meanwhile, the lack of fully reconstructed communities keeps methods to estimate viral diversity relevant.
