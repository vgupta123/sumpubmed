we aimed to characterize the genetic determinants of biofilm formation in a usa <dig> skin abscess isolate  that formed prolific biofilms.
usa <dig> s. aureus strains, tch <dig> and fpr <dig>  were found to be closely related based on whole genome mapping  to uas <dig> , however differed markedly in biofilm formation  on a dynamic assay .
corresponding tn  knockout mutants in these target genes were obtained from a publicly available mutant library of the same clonal lineage  and were characterized phenotypically for biofilm formation.
tn mutants showing significant differences in biofilm formation were utilized for transduction into a plasmid-cured erythromycin-sensitive derivative of uas <dig> and for complementation experiments.
screening of tn mutants disrupted in these target genes identified one mutant  bearing a transposon insertion in sausa300_ <dig> , which exhibited increased biofilm formation similar to uas <dig> .
transduction experiments confirmed that faka::tn corresponded to  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increase in biofilm formation depending on the usa <dig> strain background , while complementation of the tch <dig> wild-type faka allele in uas <dig> resulted in a  <dig> -fold reduction in biofilm formation .
this sequential approach, consisting of strain typing, genome comparison and functional genomics, identified faka, a recently described fatty acid kinase in s. aureus that is essential for phospholipid synthesis and also impacts the transcription of numerous virulence factors, as a negative regulator of biofilm formation in s. aureus usa <dig>
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus -usa <dig> is notorious for its ability to cause community- and healthcare-acquired infections, which are even more difficult to treat when associated with a biofilm phenotype.
comparison of whole genome sequences of these strains identified differences in a total of  <dig> genes.
