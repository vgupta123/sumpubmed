mammary tumors are the most common tumor type in intact female dogs.
however, the expression of canine brca <dig> in mammary tumors is unclear.
brca <dig> mrna levels were compared between seven mammary gland samples and seventeen mammary tumor samples isolated from dogs.
the expression level of canine brca <dig> in mammary tumor samples was lower than levels in mammary gland samples.
we attempted to identify why the brca <dig> expression level was decreased in mammary tumor samples by promoter sequencing analysis; however, we did not find any mutations in the canine brca <dig> promoter that altered brca <dig> transcription levels.
we did detect two types of brca <dig> splice variants in  <dig> mammary tumor samples.
reduced expression of canine brca <dig> mrna in mammary tumor samples is a possible mechanism to explain mammary tumor development in dogs.
one possible reason for reduced brca <dig> mrna levels in these tumor samples was nonsense-mediated mrna decay, not mutations in the brca <dig> promoter region.
while it remains unclear why canine brca <dig> expression levels are reduced in mammary tumor samples, this study found that the expression level of brca <dig> was associated with canine mammary tumorigenesis.
one of the variants induced a frame-shift mutation that could lead to nonsense-mediated mrna decay, a ubiquitous cellular mechanism that eliminates mrna containing a premature termination codon.

the expression level of brca <dig> is important for its dna repair function in mammalian cells, and its expression level is linked to tumorigenesis in mammary tissue.
