a series of duplications occurred in the common ancestor of seed plants leading to the original split of flowering plant mir <dig> and mir <dig>  the results also indicate that the expression of mir159/ <dig> is regulated at post-transcriptional level to switch on the expression of alternative mirnas during development in a highly spatio-temporal specific manner, and to selectively respond to the disruption of defensive sirna pathways.
our results support that the mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes evolve from a common ancestor, which is likely to be a phased stem-loop small rna.
our analyses also suggest that some mir159/ <dig> have evolved into unusual mirna genes that are regulated at post-transcriptional level to express multiple mature products with variable proportions under different circumstances.
despite high similarity in conservation pattern and mature mirna sequences, mir <dig> and mir <dig> have distinct expression patterns, targets and functions.
however the phylogeny of mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes and why such unusual style of mirna production has been conserved during evolution is not well understood.
through duplication and loss of genes this mirna gene family formed clades specific to moss, lycopods, gymnosperms and angiosperms including the two major clades of flowering plants containing the founding members of mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes in a.thaliana.
moreover, our analyses reveal conserved regulatory link of mir159/ <dig> genes to sirna pathway through post-transcriptional regulation.
mir <dig> and mir <dig> are highly conserved mirnas essential for plant development and fertility.
