future work includes considering our refactoring approach during the phase of workflow design and proposing guidelines for designing distilled workflows.
we have conducted a thorough study of the workflows structures available in taverna, with the aim of finding out workflow fragments whose structure could be made simpler without altering the workflow semantics.
we have designed and implemented an approach to improving workflow structure by way of rewriting preserving workflow semantics.
in this work, we propose effective methods for workflow design, with a focus on the taverna model.
scientific workflows management systems are increasingly used to specify and manage bioinformatics experiments.
lastly, we provide an implementation of our refactoring approach that we evaluate on both the public taverna workflows and on a private collection of workflows from the biovel project.
their programming model appeals to bioinformaticians, who can use them to easily specify complex data processing pipelines.

rewriting workflows in this way will be beneficial both in terms of user experience , and in terms of operational efficiency .
