we therefore developed a statistical method to distinguish weakly transcribed genes from background transcription.

transcriptomes of ehec were sequenced under  <dig> different biotic and abiotic conditions: lb medium at ph <dig>  ph <dig>  ph <dig>  or at 15°c; lb with nitrite or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; lb-agar surface, m <dig> minimal medium, spinach leaf juice, surface of living radish sprouts, and cattle feces.
the pathogenicity island lee showed highest transcriptional activity in lb medium, minimal medium, and after treatment with antibiotics.
we find that 96% of all genes and  <dig> % of the hypothetical genes exhibit a significant transcriptional signal under at least one condition.
unique sets of genes, including many hypothetical genes, are highly up-regulated on radish sprouts, cattle feces, or in the presence of antibiotics.
thus, ngs-transcriptomics is an appropriate technique to propose new roles of hypothetical genes and to guide future research.
to identify genetic determinants expressed under a variety of environmental factors, we applied strand-specific rna-sequencing, comparing the solid and illumina systems.
furthermore, we observed induction of the shiga-toxin carrying phages by antibiotics and confirmed active biofilm related genes on radish sprouts, in cattle feces, and on agar plates.
multiple infection sources for enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  are known, including animal products, fruit and vegetables.
comparing solid and illumina systems, we find a high correlation between both approaches for fold-changes of the induced or repressed genes.
for instance, the environmental function of azor had been elusive, but this gene is highly active on radish sprouts.
