in hematophagous arthropods, they are implicated in the successful accomplishment of the blood meal, interfering with platelet aggregation, blood coagulation and inflammation and in the transmission of disease parasites such as trypanosoma cruzi and borrelia burgdorferi.
it was determined that two hydrophobic clusters of residues are conserved by analysing the ten lipocalin structures and sequences.
this study could be applied to other protein families with low pairwise similarity, such as the structurally related fatty acid binding proteins or avidins.
the pairwise sequence identity is low among this family, often below 30%, despite a well conserved tertiary structure.
the only safe way to assign a sequence to that family is by experimental determination.
to further help in that task, the residues implicated in the stabilisation of the lipocalin fold were determined.
ftir data support the lipocalin fold for this protein.
since the residues implicated are not conserved for function, they should provide the minimal subset necessary to confer the lipocalin fold.
this information was used to assess assignment of lir <dig> a protein from ixodes ricinus and to build a 3d model that helps to predict function.
by sequence and structural analyzes, two conserved clusters of hydrophobic residues in interactions have been identified in lipocalins.
