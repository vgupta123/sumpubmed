the analysis of the reconstructed phylomes  allowed us to detect genes that are shared in pathogenic leishmania species, such as calpain-like cysteine peptidases and 3'a2rel-related proteins, or genes that could be associated with visceral or cutaneous development.
our results highlight the importance of proteome wide phylogenetic analyses to detect adaptation and evolutionary processes in different organisms and underscore the need to characterize the role of expanded and species-specific proteins in the context of leishmania evolution by providing a framework for the phylogenetic relationships of leishmania proteins.
our findings demonstrated that gene duplication constitutes an important evolutionary force in leishmania, acting on protein families that mediate host-parasite interactions, such as amastins, gp <dig> metallopeptidases, cathepsin l-like proteases, and our methods permitted a deeper analysis of their phylogenetic relationships.
this analysis also established the phylogenetic relationship of several hypothetical proteins whose roles remain to be characterized.
to improve our knowledge regarding the parasite biology and adaptation mechanisms of different leishmania species, we conducted a proteome-wide phylogenomic analysis to gain insights into leishmania evolution.
however, understanding of the species-specific adaptations responsible for these features and their evolutionary background is limited.
