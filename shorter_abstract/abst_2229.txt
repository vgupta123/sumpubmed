matrix-metalloproteinase upregulation in ischemia reperfusion can be imaged acutely in-vivo with nirf using mmpsense <dig>  hypothermia attenuated both the optical increase in intensity after mmpsense <dig> and the increase in mmp- <dig> protein expression supporting the proof of concept that nirf imaging using mmpsense can be used to assess potential therapeutic strategies for stroke treatment.
near-infrared  fluorescent images of mmpsense activation were acquired using an olympus fluorescent microscope,  <dig> x objective, a ccd camera and an appropriate filter cube for detecting the activated probe with peak excitation and emission at  <dig> and 775 nm, respectively.
we investigated the use of a new mmp activatable probe mmpsense™  <dig> fast  for in-vivo visualization of early mmp activity in ischemic stroke.
these observations corresponded with a significant increase in the total mmp- <dig> protein levels,  <dig> and  <dig> hours following ischemia reperfusion  and their reduction by hypothermia.
