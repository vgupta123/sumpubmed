close inspection of the elements revealed that these two families were previously mis-categorized and, unlike other known tes, insert specifically at dinucleotide “at”.
atons are novel mobile genetic elements bearing terminal inverted repeats and insert specifically at dinucleotide “at”.
active transposons are considered valuable tools to propagate pathogen resistance transgenes among mosquitoes, rendering the whole population recalcitrant to diseases.
therefore, endogenous active transposons in mosquito genomes are highly desirable.
transposon display analysis of aton- <dig> family using different a. aegypti strains suggests that the elements are similarly abundant in the tested mosquito strains.
starting with the transposable element database of the yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti genome, detailed analyses of the members of each te family were performed to identify sequences with multiple identical copies, an indicator of their latest or current transposition activity.
aton-i has a total copy number of  <dig>  among which three elements have more than  <dig> identical copies .
aton-ii has a total copy number of  <dig>  among which three elements have more than  <dig> identical copies .
five aton families contain elements existing at more than  <dig> identical copies, suggesting very recent or current transposition activity.

studies on genetic control of mosquito mediated disease transmission gained traction recently due to mosquito transgenesis technology.
genome wide searches revealed additional  <dig> aton families in a. aegypti genome with nearly  <dig> copies in total.
among a dozen of potentially active te families, two dna elements  are short and nonautonomous.
