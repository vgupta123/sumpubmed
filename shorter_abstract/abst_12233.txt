these results significantly unveil the structure and evolution of the hippo pathway in distant phyla and provide valuable clues for further examination of hippo signaling.
the hippo pathway controls growth by mediating cell proliferation and apoptosis.
the hippo pathway receives inputs from multiple developmental pathways and interacts with many tissue-specific transcription factors, but how genes in the pathway have evolved remains inadequately revealed.
to explore the origin and evolution of hippo pathway, we have extensively examined  <dig> hippo pathway genes, including upstream regulators and downstream targets, in  <dig> organisms covering major metazoan phyla.
the two essential upstream regulators cadherins fat and dachsous may have originated in the unicellular organism monosiga brevicollis and evolved more significantly than the core of the pathway.
coevolutionary analysis reveals that most functional domains in hippo genes have coevolved with interacting functional domains in other genes.
the core of the pathway is more conserved than its upstream regulators and downstream targets.
potential recombination breakpoints were identified in some genes.
genes having varied numbers of exons in different species, recombination events, and the gain and loss of some genes indicate alternative splicing and species-specific evolution.
coevolution signals explain some species-specific loss of functional domains.
