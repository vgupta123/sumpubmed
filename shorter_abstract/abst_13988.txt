transgenic cell lines maintained stable gag transgene integration and expression up to  <dig> cell passages, and although the level of vlps produced was low compared to baculovirus-produced vlps, they appeared similar in size and morphology to baculovirus-expressed vlps.
we used piggybac transposition as a novel method to create transgenic insect cell lines for continuous vlp production as an alternative to the baculovirus system.
drawbacks to this production system include contamination of vlp preparations with baculovirus and the necessity for routine maintenance of infectious baculovirus stock.
in a murine immunogenicity study, whereas baculovirus-produced vlps elicited good cd <dig> immune responses in mice when used to boost a prime with a dna vaccine, no boost response was elicited by transgenically produced vlps.
transgenic insect cells are stable and can produce hiv pr <dig> gag vlps for over  <dig> passages: this novel result may simplify strategies aimed at making protein subunit vaccines for hiv.
immunogenicity of the gag vlps in mice was less than that of baculovirus-produced vlps, which may be due to lack of baculovirus glycoprotein incorporation in the transgenic cell vlps.
insect baculovirus-produced human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  gag virus-like-particles  stimulate good humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in animals and are thought to be suitable as a vaccine candidate.
