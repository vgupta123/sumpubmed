a large group  of these genes shared high homology with genes involved in metabolism and photosynthesis;  <dig> % to genes with functions related to disease defense and signal transduction; and those in the remaining groups  to genes involved in transcription, transport processes, protein metabolism, and cell structure, respectively.
based on the analyses of homology to genes known to play a role in defense, signal transduction and protein metabolism,  <dig> tdfs were chosen and their expression patterns revealed by the cdna-aflp technique were confirmed using the qrt-pcr analysis.
stripe rust of wheat, caused by puccinia striiformis f. sp.
resistance to stripe rust in wheat cv.
moreover, we also found that plant responses in compatible and incompatible interactions are qualitatively similar but quantitatively different soon after stripe rust fungus infection.
the objective of this study was to identify transcriptionally regulated genes during an incompatible interaction between wheat and pst using cdna-aflp technique
through comparing tdfs identified in the present study for incompatible interaction and those identified in the previous study for compatible interactions,  <dig> tdfs were shared by both interactions,  <dig> were expressed specifically in the incompatible interaction, of which the specificity of  <dig> selected transcripts were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction .
we uncovered a number of new candidate genes possibly involved in the interactions of wheat and pst, of which  <dig> tdfs expressed specifically in the incompatible interaction.
due to special features of hexaploid wheat with large and complex genome and difficulties for transformation, and of pst without sexual reproduction and hard to culture on media, the use of most genetic and molecular techniques in studying genes involved in the wheat-pst interactions has been largely limited.
a total of  <dig>  transcript derived fragments  were generated with  <dig> primer pairs and  <dig>   of them displayed altered expression patterns after inoculation with  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated.
we obtained reliable sequences  for  <dig> selected tdfs, of which  <dig>  had putative functions identified.
tritici , is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide.
