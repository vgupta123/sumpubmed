ganoderma, a white rot basidiomycete widely distributed worldwide, could secrete lignin-modifying enzymes , including laccase , lignin peroxidases  and mnp.
we infer that, in the initial stages of the reaction, the catechol-mediated cycle should be the principal route of enzymatic degradation of phenol and its oxidation products.
phenol and its principal degradation products including hydroquinone, pyrocatechol, resorcinol, benzoquinone, were detected successfully in the experiments.
manganese peroxidase  of white rot basidiomycetes, an extracellular heme enzyme, is part of a peroxidase superfamily that is capable of degrading the different phenolic compounds.
after the selection of a g. lucidum strain from five ganoderma strains, the 1092 bp full-length cdna of the mnp gene, designated as g. lucidum mnp , was cloned from the selected strain.
