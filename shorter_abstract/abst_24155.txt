comparison of gene expression levels between pools and treatments identified candidate genes for further analysis of the genetic basis of drought tolerance in red clover.
one of the most striking results from the expression analysis was that the drought sensitive plants were characterised by having approximately twice the number of differentially expressed transcript tags than the tolerant plants after drought.
this de novo assembly of a red clover transcriptome from leaf material of droughted and non-droughted plants provides a rich source for gene identification, single nucleotide polymorphisms  and short sequence repeats .
furthermore, the concentration of three metabolites, particularly pinitol, but also proline and malate increased in leaves after drought stress.

a de novo transcriptome reconstruction based on the rna-seq data was made, resulting in  <dig> contigs, representing ‘transcript tags’.
these transcript tags were annotated with gene ontology  terms.
key metabolites were measured and rna-seq analysis was carried out on four bulked samples: the two pools sampled before and after drought.
plants from a full sib mapping family were used in a drought experiment, in which the growth rate and relative water content  identified two pools of ten plants contrasting in their tolerance to drought.
massively parallel sequencing was used to analyse the bulked rna samples.
red clover  is a versatile forage crop legume, which can tolerate a variety of soils and is suitable for silage production for winter feed and for grazing.
better water-stress tolerance is one of the key factors influencing persistency, but little is known about how red clover tolerates water stress.
before onset of drought the sensitive plants overexpressed a number of genes annotated as senescence-related.
