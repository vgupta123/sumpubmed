we found in vitro antibacterial activity of l-prp and p-prp and the possibility to cryopreserve l-prp, without important changes to its effectiveness; similar microbicidal activity between preparations containing or not leukocytes; and the contribution of three new molecules .
human platelets are a rich reservoir of molecules that promote regenerative processes and microbicidal activity.
therefore, this study aimed at comparing the in vitro microbicidal activity of platelets and leukocyte-enriched prp  to pure platelet-rich plasma  and the contribution of leukocytes to microbicidal properties.
despite extensive use in clinical procedures, only few studies have investigated prp’s real microbicidal potential.
antimicrobial effects of p- and l-prp were tested against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis.
furthermore, l-prp was frozen  to assess whether the preparation maintained in vitro characteristics.
l-prp, l-prp cryo and p-prp generally induced comparable bacterial growth inhibition for up to 4 h’ incubation, range 1– <dig> log.
microbicidal proteins released by the three preparations were also evaluated.
