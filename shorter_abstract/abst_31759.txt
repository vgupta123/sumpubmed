ag <dig>  an inhibitor of stat <dig> inhibited basal and thrombin-provoked prommp- <dig> release and phosphorylation of stat <dig>  pd <dig>  an inhibitor of mapk and ly <dig>  an inhibitor pi3k failed to significantly inhibit thrombin induced prommp- <dig> release.
thrombin is a potent stimulus of prommp- <dig> release from hdfs.
it has been recognized that dermal fibroblasts and matrix metalloproteases  play crucial roles in wound healing process in skin.
thrombin was found to stimulate il- <dig> release from human dermal fibroblasts .
however, little is known of the effect of thrombin on secretion of mmps from dermal fibroblasts.
the results showed that thrombin induced prommp- <dig>  but not prommp- <dig> release from hdfs in a dose dependent manner at  <dig> h following incubation.
in the present study, the influence of thrombin on prommp- <dig> and prommp- <dig> activity release from primary cultured hdfs, and its potential signaling pathways were investigated.
an agonist peptide of protease-activated receptor- <dig>  sfllr-nh <dig> stimulated an enhanced release of prommp- <dig> from hdfs.
