as an application, metagun was used to predict genes for two samples of human gut microbiome.
to identify protein-coding sequences, metagun builds the universal module and the novel module.
comparisons on artificial shotgun fragments with multiple current metagenomic gene finders show that metagun predicts better results on both 3' and 5' ends of genes with fragments of various lengths.
further analysis indicates that metagun tends to predict more potential novel genes than other current metagenomic gene finders.
then, protein-coding sequences are identified for each group independently with svm classifiers that integrate entropy density profiles  of codon usage, translation initiation site  scores and open reading frame  length as input patterns.
the former is based on a set of representative species, while the latter is designed to find potential functionary dna sequences with conserved domains.
firstly, it classifies input fragments into phylogenetic groups by a k-mer based sequence binning method.
especially, it makes the most reliable predictions among these methods.
accurately identifying genes from metagenomic fragments is one of the most fundamental issues.
in this article, we present a novel gene prediction method named metagun for metagenomic fragments based on a machine learning approach of svm.

metagenomic sequencing is becoming a powerful technology for exploring micro-ogranisms from various environments, such as human body, without isolation and cultivation.
it identifies thousands of additional genes with significant evidences.
