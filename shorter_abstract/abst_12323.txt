context-based data preprocessing improves mining results by producing superior interpretable models, which makes it well-suited for practical applications in molecular docking simulations using ffr models.
data preprocessing is a major step in data mining.
the test cases used a fully-flexible receptor  model of mycobacterium tuberculosis inha enzyme  and four different ligands.
in data preprocessing, several known techniques can be applied, or new ones developed, to improve data quality such that the mining results become more accurate and intelligible.
in this article, we propose a context-based data preprocessing approach to mine data from molecular docking simulation results.
statistical analysis of the results shows that the proposed context-based data preprocessing approach significantly improves predictive and context measures and outperforms the cfs algorithm.
additionally, we produced an extra dataset containing features selected by combining our context strategy and the cfs algorithm.
we generated an initial set of attributes as well as their respective instances.
to improve this initial set, we applied two selection strategies.
