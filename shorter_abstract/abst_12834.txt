information on a group of differentially expressed genes includes the sensitivity and the false discovery rate.
we conclude that the good quality of the results obtained by rdam is mainly due to the quasi-perfect equalization of variation distribution, which is related to the standardization procedure used and to the measurement of variation by rank difference.
we describe a new method, rank difference analysis of microarrays , which estimates the total number of truly varying genes and assigns a p-value to each signal variation.
