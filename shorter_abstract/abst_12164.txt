in this work, the phic <dig> recombinase gene was placed under the control of the arabidopsis oxs <dig> promoter and introduced into arabidopsis harboring a chromosomally integrated attb and attp-flanked target sequence.
we further verified that the genomic excision was conservative and that introduction of a functional recombinase can be achieved through secondary transformation as well as manual crossing.
the phic <dig> recombinase excised the attb and attp-flanked dna, and the excision event was detected in subsequent generations in the absence of the phic <dig> gene, indicating germinal transmission was possible.
the large serine recombinase phic <dig> from broad host range streptomyces temperate phage, catalyzes the site-specific recombination of two recognition sites that differ in sequence, typically known as attachment sites attb and attp.
the phic <dig> system performs site-specific recombination in germinal tissue, a prerequisite for generating stable lines with unwanted dna removed.
