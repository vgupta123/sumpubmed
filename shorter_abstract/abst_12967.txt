our results describe, for the first time, a sensory neural population with a specific molecular identity involved in the detection of pup odors.

surprisingly, activity in olfr692-positive cells is sexually dimorphic, being very low in females.
our results also show that juvenile odors activate a large number of olfr <dig> vomeronasal neurons in virgin males, which is correlated with the display of infanticide behavior.
the olfactory system detects odors via specialized sensory organs such as the main olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ.
the odorant receptor  family is expressed in sensory neurons of the main olfactory epithelium, while the adult vomeronasal organ is thought to express other types of receptors.
here, we describe olfr <dig>  a member of the or gene family identified by next-generation rna sequencing, which is highly upregulated and non-canonically expressed in the vomeronasal organ.
moreover, it is one of the first reports of a group of sensory neurons the activity of which is sexually dimorphic and depends on social status.
sensory neurons in these organs use g-protein coupled receptors to detect chemosensory stimuli.
in contrast, activity substantially decreases in parenting males , where infanticidal aggressive behavior is not frequently observed.
olfaction is a fundamental sense through which most animals perceive the external world.
