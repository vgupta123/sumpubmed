however hspc300-colonies on bacteria are larger and more similar to wild type, suggesting that some scar function can survive without hspc <dig>  we find no evidence for functions of hspc <dig> outside the scar complex.
as has been seen in other regulatory complex mutants, scar is lost in these cells, apparently by a post-translational mechanism, though pir <dig> levels do not change.
