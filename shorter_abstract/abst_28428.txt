the study included comparisons of their ploidy, homozygosity, genome integrity, and gene dosage, using chromosome counting, flow cytometry, ssr marker genotyping, and array-comparative genomic hybridization .
chromosome counting and flow cytometry revealed that esp and fra were haploid, but ita was tri-haploid.
nules, designated esp, fra, and ita , were selected for cytological and molecular characterization in order to elucidate genomic rearrangements provoked by haploidization.
homozygous patterns, represented by a single peak , were observed among the three plants at almost all ssr loci distributed across the entire diploid donor genome.
the presence of few gene hybridization abnormalities, corroborated by gene dosage measurements, were hypothetically due to the segregation of hemizygous alleles and minor genomic rearrangements occurring during the haploidization procedure.
