promoter-lacz fusions with selected intragenic σ <dig> binding sites suggest that many of these sites are capable of functioning as σ54-dependent promoters.
we also identified a novel σ54-dependent promoter upstream of stm <dig>  a homolog of the cas <dig> component of a crispr system.
in this work, we assess the ability of a promiscuous, constitutively-active bebp—the aaa+ atpase domain of dctd from sinorhizobium meliloti—to activate transcription from all σ54-dependent promoters for the characterization of the σ <dig> regulon of salmonella typhimurium lt <dig>
the aaa+ atpase domain of dctd was able to drive transcription from nearly all previously characterized or predicted σ54-dependent promoters in salmonella under a single condition.
since the dctd aaa+ atpase domain proved effective in activating transcription from the diverse σ54-dependent promoters of the s. typhimurium lt <dig> σ <dig> regulon under a single growth condition, this approach is likely to be valuable for examining σ <dig> regulons in other bacterial species.
a significant complication in analysis of the global σ <dig> regulon in a bacterium is that the σ <dig> rna polymerase holoenzyme requires interaction with an active bacterial enhancer-binding protein  to initiate transcription at a σ54-dependent promoter.
chip-chip analysis revealed at least  <dig> σ <dig> binding sites in the chromosome, of which 58% are located within coding sequences.
