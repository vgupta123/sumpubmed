our data provide new clues to the mechanism of viral susceptibility in epc cells.
our findings demonstrate previously unrecognised changes in gene transcription that are associated with svcv infection in vitro, and many potential cascades identified in the study clearly warrant further experimental investigation.
these raw data were assembled into  <dig>  contigs.
of these contigs,  <dig>  and  <dig>  had significant hits to the nr and uniprot databases where they matched  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique protein accessions, respectively.
a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean data from  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads, with a mean read length  <dig> bp, were obtained.
in this study, deep rna sequencing was used to analyse the transcriptome and gene expression profile of epc cells at progressive times after svcv infection.
at  <dig> h post svcv infection , a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in epc cells compared to non-infected cells, including  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes.
these regulated genes were primarily involved in pathways of apoptosis, oxidative stress and the interferon system, all of which may be involved in viral pathogenesis.
spring viraemia of carp virus  has been identified as the causative agent of spring viraemia of carp  and it has caused significant losses in the cultured common carp  industry.
this study addressed the complexity of virusâ€“cell interactions and added knowledge that may help to understand svcv.
