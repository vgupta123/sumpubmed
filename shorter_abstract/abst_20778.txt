however, there is a need for a versatile and inexpensive led array platform where individual wavebands can be specifically tuned to produce a series of light combinations consisting of various quantities and qualities of individual wavelengths.
the presentation of these proven plans for led array construction allows the teacher, researcher or electronics aficionado a means to inexpensively build efficient, adjustable lighting modules for plant research.
although specific light attributes, such as color and fluence rate, influence plant growth and development, researchers generally cannot control the fine spectral conditions of artificial plant-growth environments.
these factors render led-based light strategies particularly appropriate for space-biology as well as terrestrial applications.
these arrays represent a means to modulate precise quality and quantity in experimental settings to test the effect of specific light combinations in regulating plant growth, development and plant-product yield.
plant growth chambers are typically outfitted with fluorescent and/or incandescent fixtures that provide a general spectrum that is accommodating to the human eye and not necessarily supportive to plant development.
leds are particularly well suited for plant growth chambers, as they have an extraordinary life , require little maintenance, and use negligible energy.
in this technical report we describe the practical construction of tunable red-green-blue led arrays to support research in plant growth and development.
many studies over the last several decades, primarily in arabidopsis thaliana, have clearly shown that variation in light quantity, quality and photoperiod can be manipulated to affect growth and control developmental transitions.
