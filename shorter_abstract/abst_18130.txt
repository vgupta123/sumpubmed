here, we present the first detailed computational analysis of the sequence and predicted structure of the protein encoded by fto.
profile-to-sequence and profile-to-profile based comparisons identified remote homologs of the non-heme dioxygenase family.
our analysis suggests that human fto is a member of the non-heme dioxygenase - and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases) superfamily.
we performed a sequence similarity search using the human fto protein as query and then generated a profile using the multiple sequence alignment of the homologous sequences.
