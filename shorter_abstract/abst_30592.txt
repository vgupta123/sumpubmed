amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone were the most effective antimicrobials for the isolates of h. influenzae across the 10-year period.
our previous study showed that h. influenzae is the second most common pathogen causing pneumonia and accounts for 30–50% of bacterial meningitis among chinese children.
h. influenzae carriage in children and its resistance to commonly used antimicrobials varies widely both geographically and over time.
surveys of the nasopharyngeal carriage of h. influenzae in children younger than  <dig> years of age with acute respiratory tract infection  were conducted in beijing children’s hospital, china in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the overall annual carriage rates of h. influenzae among children younger than  <dig> years of age with ari were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, and the percentages of h. influenzae isolates producing β-lactamase were 4%, 13%,  <dig> %, and 31%, respectively.
this report on the h. influenzae carriage rates in children and the susceptibility of these bacteria to commonly used antibiotics showed that h. influenzae carriage decreased from  <dig> to  <dig>  additionally, the percentage of β-lactamase-producing isolates increased while their susceptibility to ampicillin progressively decreased during this time.
these results indicate that the appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy should be changed for pediatric patients in china.
haemophilus influenzae is one of the main pathogens that cause community-acquired respiratory infections in children.
all of the ampicillin-resistant isolates were found to be beta-lactamase producers.
