the overall hemoplasma prevalence rate was  <dig> % .
the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hemoplasma spp.
outdoor access, male gender, and fiv infection are additional risk factors that might relate to aggressive interactions and exposure to vectors.
results were evaluated in relation to the age, sex, housing conditions, feline leukemia virus  and feline immunodeficiency virus  status of the cats.
dna was extracted from blood samples of  <dig> cats presented to different veterinary hospitals for various reasons.
mhm infection is common in cats in southern germany.
there was a significantly higher risk of hemoplasma infection in cats from multi-cat households, in outdoor cats, as well as in cats with fivinfection and in cats with abortive felv infection, but not in cats with progressive or regressive felv infection.
