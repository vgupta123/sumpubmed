in total,  <dig> prp <dig> inteins have been detected in species from three different orders of euascomycetes, including aspergillus nidulans and aspergillus fumigatus , paracoccidiodes brasiliensis, uncinocarpus reesii and histoplasma capsulatum  and botrytis cinerea .
we compare and contrast the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of the prp <dig> intein and the saccharomycete vma intein, in order to derive a broader understanding of eukaryote intein evolution.
bio-informatic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that many of the ascomycete prp <dig> homing endonucleases are active.
the evolution of eukaryote inteins is not well understood.
it has been suggested that eukaryote inteins undergo horizontal transfer and the present analysis explores this proposal.
this suggests that the intein is of ancient origin and has been vertically transmitted amongst the euascomycetes.
some of the prp <dig> inteins contain apparently intact homing endonuclease domains and are thus potentially mobile, while some lack the region corresponding to the homing endonuclease and are thus mini-inteins.
