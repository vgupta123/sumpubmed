it first uses the na√Øve bayesian classifier to assess the likelihood of functional linkage between gene pairs based on prior knowledge.
a candidate network edge reservoir is then created in which the copy number of each edge is proportional to the estimated likelihood of linkage between the two corresponding genes.
we evaluated the new algorithm using both simulated and real gene expression data including that from a yeast cell cycle and a mouse pancreas development/growth study.
as each type of prior knowledge on its own may be incomplete or limited by quality issues, integrating multiple sources of prior knowledge to utilize their consensus is desirable.
we introduce a new method to incorporate the quantitative information from multiple sources of prior knowledge.
bayesian network  is a powerful approach to reconstructing genetic regulatory networks from gene expression data.
in contrast, without the prior knowledge bn modeling is not always better than a random selection, demonstrating the necessity in network modeling to supplement the gene expression data with additional information.
our new development provides a statistical means to utilize the quantitative information in prior biological knowledge in the bn modeling of gene expression data, which significantly improves the performance.
in network simulation the markov chain monte carlo sampling algorithm is adopted, and samples from this reservoir at each iteration to generate new candidate networks.
in this study we included cocitation in pubmed and schematic similarity in gene ontology annotation.
however, expression data by itself suffers from high noise and lack of power.
incorporating prior biological knowledge can improve the performance.
