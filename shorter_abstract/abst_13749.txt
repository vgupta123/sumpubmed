genebrowser fills the gap between web portals that analyse one gene at a time and functional analysis tools that are limited in scope and usually desktop-based.
the functionalities provided include the following: a central point with the most relevant biological information for each inserted gene; a list of the most related papers in pubmed and gene expression studies in arrayexpress; and an extended approach to functional analysis applied to gene ontology, homologies, gene chromosomal localisation and pathways.
the required information is typically available in public databases, and usually, this information must be manually retrieved to complement the analysis.
genebrowser is a web-based tool that, for a given list of genes, combines data from several public databases with visualisation and analysis methods to help identify the most relevant and common biological characteristics.
