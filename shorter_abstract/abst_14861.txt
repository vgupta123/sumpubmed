fecal samples from  <dig> fruit bats , were combined into  <dig> pools and analyzed using viral metagenomics.
the existence of a vast genetic variability of picorna-like viruses in fruit bats may increase the probability of spillover infections to humans especially when humans and bats have direct contact as the case in this study site.
in total, picornavirales reads were found in  <dig> pools, and  complete genomes of  <dig> picorna-like viruses were obtained from  <dig> of these pools.
the picorna-like viruses possessed varied genomic organizations , and arrangements of gene cassettes.
the order picornavirales represents a diverse group of positive-stranded rna viruses with small non-enveloped icosahedral virions.
phylogenetic and nucleotide composition analyses suggested that mammals were the likely host species of bat sapelovirus, bat kunsagivirus and bat crohivirus, whereas the remaining viruses  were most likely diet-derived.
since many members of the picornaviridae family cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals, this study aimed to characterize members of the order picornavirales in fruit bat populations located in the southwest region of cameroon.
