the hepatic content of atp was significantly higher  in ehl piglets, which was associated with lower mtdna copy number .
we also detected  <dig> differentially expressed nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, among which isocitrate dehydrogenase  <dig>  and atp synthase, h+ transporting, mitochondrial fo complex, subunit d  were expressed significantly lower, while adenylate kinase  <dig>  was significantly over expressed in ehl piglets.
moreover, higher expression of ak <dig> in ehl piglets was also associated with lower cytosine methylation  and hydroxymethylation .
these results indicate a role of the gr in the breed-dependent regulation of mitochondrial genes in the liver of newborn piglets.
compared to lw, the over expression of mtdna-encoded genes in ehl was associated with significantly higher  glucocorticoid receptor  binding to the control region of mtdna with no alterations in the methylation status.
most of the mtdna-encoded genes , however, were more abundantly expressed in ehl compared to lw piglets.
different breeds of pigs demonstrate distinct metabolic profiles in the liver, yet little is known whether the expression and transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial genes differ between breeds.

for nuclear-encoded genes, however, a negative correlation was observed between gr binding and mrna expression of ak <dig> and atp5h.
