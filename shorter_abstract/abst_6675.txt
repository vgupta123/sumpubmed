primary open angle glaucoma is a heterogeneous group of optic neuropathies that results in optic nerve degeneration and a loss of retinal ganglion cells  ultimately causing blindness if allowed to progress.
elevated iop results in an appreciable change in eta receptor expression in the retina.
overexpression of the eta receptor results in an overall decrease in cell viability, accompanied by an increase in etb receptor levels, suggesting the involvement of both eta and etb receptors in mediating cell death.
the purpose of this study was to examine changes in endothelin a  receptor protein expression in the retinas of adult male brown norway rats following iop elevation by the morrison’s model of ocular hypertension and the impact of eta receptor overexpression on rgc viability in vitro.
after 2 weeks of iop elevation, immunohistochemical analysis of retinal sections from rat eyes showed an increasing trend in immunostaining for eta receptors in multiple retinal layers including the inner plexiform layer, ganglion cell layer and outer plexiform layer.
a modest increase in staining for eta receptors was also found in the outer plexiform layer in the retina of rats with iop elevation.
cell culture studies showed that overexpression of eta receptors in 661w cells as well as primary rgcs decreases cell viability, compared to empty vector transfected cells.
adeno-associated virus mediated overexpression of the eta receptor produced an increase in the etb receptor in primary rgcs.
these findings raise possibilities for the development of eta/etb dual receptor antagonists as neuroprotective treatments for glaucomatous neuropathy.
following 4 weeks of iop elevation, a significant increase in immunostaining for eta receptor expression was found in the retina, primarily in the inner plexiform layer and ganglion cells.
iop elevation was carried out in one eye of brown norway rats by injection of hypertonic saline through episcleral veins.
the endothelin system is a key target for intervention against glaucomatous neurodegeneration.
