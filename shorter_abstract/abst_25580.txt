based on the identified subtypes, we developed a pca-based approach for subtype-specific identification of cancer drivers.
while cancer is generally believed to have been caused by genetic aberrations, the number of such events is tremendous in the cancer tissue and only a small subset of them may be tumorigenic.
we report a systematic method to automate the identification of cancer subtypes and candidate drivers.
they are characterized with different behaviors in clinical and molecular profiles, such as survival rates, gene signature and copy number aberrations .

specifically, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternates between gene expression clustering and gene signature selection.
the top-ranked driver candidates are found to be enriched with known pathways in certain subtypes of mb.
the subtyping algorithm consistently converges on multiple datasets of medulloblastoma, and the converged signatures and copy number landscapes are also found to be highly reproducible across the datasets.
using high-throughput data to link these factors to define subtype boundaries and identify subtype-specific drivers, is a promising yet largely unexplored topic.
our study indicates that subtype-signature defines the subtype boundaries, characterizes the subtype-specific processes and can be used to prioritize signature-related drivers.
