depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts stimulated less proliferation of pbmc, and reduced effector cell numbers after 7 days in culture than did native extracts.
however, the frequency of foxp3+ tregs in cultures were similar to those seen with native extract so that ratios of regulatory to effector t cells were significantly increased in cultures stimulated with depigmented-polymerised extracts.
we compared the capacity of modified  versus unmodified  allergen extracts of grass pollen and house dust mite to stimulate proliferation/cytokine production and to modulate treg/effector t cell frequency in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells , from volunteers sensitised to both allergens in vitro.
depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts appear to favour treg expansion over activation of effector t cells and this may relate to their demonstrated efficacy and safety in sit.
1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> further reduces effector t cell activation by allergen extracts and may be a useful adjuvant for sit.
it is suggested that these allergoid extracts also have reduced t cell activity, which could compromise clinical efficacy.
allergen immunotherapy  is the only treatment for allergic disease capable of modifying disease long term.
effective sit is thought to act through regulatory t cells  rather than activation of effector t cells.
addition of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> further favoured treg, and reduced effector cytokine production, but not interleukin- <dig>
