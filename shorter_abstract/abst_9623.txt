we describe the sparse accumulation of prpsc in the placentas of goats with naturally acquired classical scrapie in comparison to field cases of classical ovine scrapie.
prpsc accumulation patterns in the intact placentome and western blot banding was similar in the caprine and ovine samples.
prpsc accumulates in the shed placentas of goats with naturally acquired scrapie.
domestic goats  are a natural and experimental host of scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  of sheep and cattle.
although these levels were low in most caprine samples, the caprine placenta may contribute to prion contamination of kidding facilities and transmission to co-housed sheep or goats.
distribution of prpsc, the abnormal prion protein, is similar in the tissues of scrapie-infected sheep and goats but no data are available on the potential shedding of the agent through the placenta, the presumed route of transmission of ovine scrapie.
