when compared to the beetle tribolium castaneum, we find that the stem lineage of flies and mosquitoes  has experienced on average a 3-fold increase in the rate of evolution.
to answer this question, we assess the rate variation between insect lineages for a large number of orthologous genes.
pairwise gene comparisons between drosophila and tribolium show a high correlation between evolutionary rates of orthologous proteins.
among the insects analysed so far, it appears that the tribolium genes show the lowest rates of divergence.
