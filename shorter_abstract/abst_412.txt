there is a growing concern regarding the increase of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in companion animals.
the aim of this study was to investigate geographical and temporal trends of antimicrobial resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection  in companion animals in europe.
isolated from companion animals from belgium.
this work brings new insights into the current status of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from companion animals with uti in europe and reinforces the need for strategies aiming to reduce resistance.
the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of the most common bacteria was determined for each country individually in the years 2012– <dig> and temporal trends of bacteria resistance were established by logistic regression.
for all bacterial species, southern countries generally presented higher levels of antimicrobial resistance compared to northern countries.

yet, there are no studies comparing the resistance levels of these organisms in european countries.
multidrug-resistant escherichia coli were found to be more prevalent in southern countries.
samples were collected between  <dig> and  <dig> from  <dig> laboratories of  <dig> european countries.
the antimicrobial susceptibility of  <dig>  <dig> bacteria isolated from dogs and cats with uti was determined.
