the finding of this very large vvtps family, combined with the importance of terpenoid metabolism for the organoleptic properties of grapevine berries and finished wines, prompted a detailed examination of this gene family at the genomic level as well as an investigation into vvtps biochemical functions.
a dense cluster of  <dig> vvtps is localized on chromosome  <dig>  extensive flcdna cloning, gene synthesis, and protein expression enabled functional characterization of  <dig> vvtps; this is the largest number of functionally characterized tps for any species reported to date.
we present findings from the analysis of the up-dated 12-fold sequencing and assembly of the grapevine genome that place the number of predicted vvtps genes at  <dig> putatively functional vvtps,  <dig> partial vvtps, and  <dig> vvtps probable pseudogenes.
phylogenetic analyses of the tps gene family showed that while most vvtps form species-specific gene clusters, there are several examples of gene orthology with tps of other plant species, representing perhaps more ancient vvtps, which have maintained functions independent of speciation.
the highly expanded vvtps gene family underpins the prominence of terpenoid metabolism in grapevine.
we provide a detailed experimental functional annotation of  <dig> members of this important gene family in grapevine and comprehensive information about gene structure and phylogeny for the entire currently known vvtps gene family.
of these enzymes,  <dig> have unique functions and/or phylogenetic locations within the plant tps gene family.
based on the initial 8-fold sequencing of a nearly homozygous pinot noir inbred line,  <dig> putative terpenoid synthase genes  were predicted by in silico analysis of the grapevine  genome assembly  <cit> .
gene discovery and annotation included information about gene architecture and chromosomal location.
