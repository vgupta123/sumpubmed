this raises the question of whether structural alignments could impact the performance of phmms trained from proteins in the twilight zone, as structural alignments are often more accurate than sequence alignments at identifying motifs and functional residues.
structural alignments were obtained using the 3dcoffee and mammoth-mult tools; sequence alignments were obtained using clustalw, tcoffee, mafft and probcons.
we observed that phmms derived from structural alignments performed significantly better than phmms derived from sequence alignment in low-identity regions, mainly below 20%.
performance was evaluated through roc curves and paired two tailed t-test.
we used the scop database to perform our experiments.
our results suggest a number of possible directions for improvements in this area.
next, we assess the impact of using structural alignments in phmm performance.
arguably, profile hidden markov models  are one of the most successful approaches in addressing this important problem.
remote homology detection is a challenging problem in bioinformatics.
on the other hand, sensitivity of these tools is still quite low for these low-identity regions.
phmm packages present a relatively small computational cost, and perform particularly well at recognizing remote homologies.
we performed leave-one-family-out cross-validation over super-families.
