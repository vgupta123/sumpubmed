it is likely that rna secondary structures play an important role in rna recognition by line encoded proteins.
the exact mechanism of how a line-encoded reverse transcriptase  recognizes its own and sine rna remains unclear.
for the relaxed-type lines it is believed that the poly-a tail is a common recognition element between line and sine rna.
the results show that a stem loop with a bulge exists at the 3′-end of alu.
other conserved stem-loop positions in l <dig> suggest their possible functions in protein-rna interactions but to date no experimental evidence has been reported.
however polyadenylation is a property of any messenger rna, and how the line rt recognizes transposon and non-transposon rnas remains an open question.
both stem-loops show structural similarity to the stem-loops of the stringent-type lines experimentally confirmed as essential for retrotransposition.
comparative structural analyses of a human l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop showed a similarity to 3′utr stem-loops of the stringent-type lines, which were experimentally shown to be recognized by line rt.
however it was shown for the stringent-type lines that recognition of a stem-loop at the 3′utr by rt is essential for retrotransposition.
here we selected a set of l <dig> and alu elements from the human genome and investigated their sequences for the presence of position-specific stem-loop structures.
here we presented an evidence for the presence of a highly conserved 3′utr stem-loop structure in l <dig> and alu retrotransposons in the human genome.
we found highly conserved stem-loop positions at the 3′utr.
we also found conserved stem-loop positions at 5′utr and at the end of orf <dig> and discuss their possible role.
here we hypothesize that both l <dig> and alu rna are recognized by l <dig> rt via the 3′-end rna stem-loop structure.
