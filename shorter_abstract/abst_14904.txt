moreover,  <dig> primer pairs  yielded pcr amplicons in the wild accession and  <dig>  were polymorphic between species.
<dig> of  <dig> validated primer pairs successfully yielded pcr amplicons in  <dig> cultivated sesame accessions.
a upgma dendrogram based on genetic similarity coefficients showed that the correlation between genotype and geographical source was low and that the genetic basis of sesame in china is narrow, as previously reported.
the total length of uni-transcript sequences was  <dig> â€‰mb, and  <dig>  ssrs  and  <dig>  ssrs  were identified.
among perfect ssrs , di-nucleotide motifs  were the most abundant, followed by tri- , hexa- , penta- , tetra- , and mono-nucleotides .
a total of  <dig>  ssr primer pairs were identified in the  <dig>  ssr-containing sequences , and  <dig> ssr primer pairs were randomly chosen for validation.
<dig>  primer pairs yielded pcr amplification products in  <dig> cultivars.
thirty two primer pairs  exhibited polymorphisms.
the  <dig> polymorphic primer pairs were validated using an f <dig> mapping population;  <dig> primer pairs exhibited polymorphisms between the parents, and  <dig> genic-ssrs could be integrated into  <dig> main linkage groups.
these ssr markers were amplified and validated in  <dig> sesame accessions .
we performed transcriptome sequencing of samples from different sesame growth and developmental stages, and mining of genic-ssr markers to identify valuable markers for sesame molecular genetics research.
<dig>  genic-ssr markers have been developed in sesame using transcriptome sequencing.
