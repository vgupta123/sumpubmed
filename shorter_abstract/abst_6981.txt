a new method, which we propose, allow to determine close to optimal threshold values for sample means and sample variances for gene filtering.
in microarray experiments the number of analyzed samples is often much lower than the number of genes  which leads to many false discoveries.
by performing analyses of several publicly available datasets and simulated datasets we demonstrate that our adaptive method increases sensitivity of finding differentially expressed genes compared to previous methods of filtering microarray data based on using fixed threshold values.
dna microarrays are used for discovery of genes expressed differentially between various biological conditions.
these techniques are two-step procedures, where in the first step some pool of non-informative genes is removed and in the second step only the pool of the retained genes is used for searching for differentially expressed genes.
the method is adaptive and based on the decomposition of the histogram of gene expression means or variances into mixture of gaussian components.
multiple testing correction methods control the number of false discoveries but decrease the sensitivity of discovering differentially expressed genes.
