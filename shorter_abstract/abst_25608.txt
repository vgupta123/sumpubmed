carolacton caused death of s. mutans biofilm cells, elongation of cell chains, and changes in cell morphology.
at a concentration of  <dig> nm carolacton, biofilm damage was already at 35% under anaerobic conditions.
expression of the competence related alternate sigma factor comx was strongly reduced by carolacton, as determined by a pcomx luciferase reporter strain.
planktonic growth of bacteria was only slightly impaired and no acute cytotoxicity against mouse fibroblasts could be observed.
a knock-out mutant for comd, encoding a histidine kinase specific for the competence stimulating peptide , was slightly less sensitive to carolacton than the wildtype.
we therefore screened a library of secondary metabolites from myxobacteria for their ability to damage biofilms of s. mutans.
here we show that carolacton, a secondary metabolite isolated from sorangium cellulosum, has high antibacterial activity against biofilms of s. mutans.
carolacton possibly interferes with the density dependent signalling systems in s. mutans and may represent a novel approach for the prevention of dental caries.
streptococcus mutans is a major pathogen in human dental caries.
