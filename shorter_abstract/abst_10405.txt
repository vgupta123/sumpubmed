during the development of immunity to, and a subsequent challenge infection with trichostrongylus colubriformis, the transcript levels of  <dig> genes of cells trafficking in afferent intestinal lymph were significantly modulated .
the transcript levels of tnf receptor associated factor  <dig> , hemopexin , cysteine dioxygenase , the major histocompatability complex class ii protein , interleukin- <dig> binding protein , ephrin a <dig>  and selenoprotein s  were modulated to the greatest degree.
this report describes gene expression profiles of afferent lymph cells in sheep developing immunity to nematode infection.
results presented show a global down-regulation of the expression of immune genes which may be reflective of the natural temporal response to nematode infections in livestock.
gastrointestinal nematode  infections are the predominant cause of economic losses in sheep.
overall, there was a clear trend for down-regulation of many genes involved in immune functions including antigen presentation, caveolar-mediated endocytosis and protein ubiquitination.
of these,  <dig> genes were modulated more than  <dig> -fold and involved in immune function.
an alternative control approach would be the induction of protective immunity to these parasites.
this study exploits an ovine microarray biased towards immune genes, an artificially induced immunity model and the use of pseudo-afferent lymphatic cannulation to sample immune cells draining from the intestine, to investigate possible mechanisms involved in the development of immunity.
