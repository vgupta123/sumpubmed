furthermore, tpa-induced s100a <dig> gene expression in hacat keratinocytes was blocked after the pharmacologic inhibition of parp- <dig> with  <dig> -isoquinolinediol .
in the present study, we investigated transcription factors that bind to mre.
using the mre motif for a pull-down assay, polypolymerase- <dig>  and the heterodimeric complex ku70/ku <dig> were identified by mass spectrometry and confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation.
s <dig> proteins, a multigenic family of non-ubiquitous cytoplasmic ca2+-binding proteins, have been linked to human pathologies in recent years.
the candidates, polypolymerase- <dig>  and the heterodimeric complex ku70/ku <dig>  are known to participate in inflammatory disorders as well as tumorgenesis.
recently, we characterized a regulatory element within the s100a <dig> promotor, referred to as mre that drives the s100a <dig> gene expression in a cell type-specific, activation- and differentiation-dependent manner  j. biol.
dysregulated expression of s <dig> proteins, including s100a <dig>  has been reported in the epidermis as a response to stress and in association with neoplastic disorders.
