the locus rk confers resistance against several species of root-knot nematodes  in cowpea .
gene ontology based functional categorization revealed that the typical defense response was partially suppressed in resistant roots, even at  <dig> dpi, allowing nematode juvenile development.
responses to m. incognita infection in roots of resistant genotype cb <dig> and a susceptible near-isogenic line  were investigated using a soybean affymetrix genechip expression array at  <dig> and  <dig> days post-inoculation .
in comparing the differentially expressed genes in response to nematode infection, a greater number and proportion of genes were down-regulated in the resistant than in the susceptible genotype, whereas more genes were up-regulated in the susceptible than in the resistant genotype.
differences in ros concentrations, induction of toxins and other defense related genes seem to play a role in this unique resistance mechanism.
at  <dig> dpi  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in incompatible interactions  and  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed in compatible interactions .
when expression between infected resistant and susceptible genotypes was compared,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively.
at  <dig> dpi the differentially expressed genes were  <dig> for the incompatible and  <dig> for the compatible interactions.
