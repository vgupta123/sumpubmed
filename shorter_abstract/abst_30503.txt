this analysis revealed an inherent competition between some tfs and nucleosomes for binding canonical tfbs.
gr and hoxa <dig> also bind motifs with low inos, perhaps indicating a different mechanism of action.
binding of hoxa <dig> and a fraction of gr to motifs with low inos values suggesting they are not in competition with nucleosomes and may function using different mechanisms.
we used chip-seq data for three transcription factors binding to their canonical motifs: c-jun binding the ap- <dig> motif , gr  binding the gr motif , and hoxa <dig>  binding the pbx  motif .
in mouse mammary  <dig> cells, c-jun and gr proteins preferentially bound regions calculated to be well-bound by nucleosomes in vitro with the canonical ap- <dig> and gr motifs themselves contributing to the high inos.
functional gr motifs are enriched for ap- <dig> motifs if they are within a nucleosome-sized 150-bps region.
chromatin plays a critical role in regulating transcription factors  binding to their canonical transcription factor binding sites .
we used a logistic regression to evaluate how well the propensity for nucleosome binding and co-occurrence of a secondary motif identify which canonical motifs are bound in vivo.
for all canonical tfbs in the mouse genome, we calculated intrinsic nucleosome occupancy scores  for its surrounding 150-bps dna and examined the relationship with in vivo tf binding.
our analysis quantified the contribution of inos and co-occurring sequence to the identification of functional canonical motifs in the genome.
recent studies in vertebrates show that many tfs preferentially bind to genomic regions that are well bound by nucleosomes in vitro.
