these results were substantiated by experimental evidence from papi- <dig> transfer assay experiments, in which outer membrane or lps preparations from well-defined lps mutants were added to the transfer mix to assess the role of p. aeruginosa lps in papi- <dig> transfer and in vitro binding experiments between pilin fusion protein gst-pilv2â€™ and immobilized lps molecules were performed.
our data also showed that p. aeruginosa strains that had already acquired a copy of papi- <dig> were unable to import additional copies of the island, and that such strains produced proportionally lower amounts of cpa lps compared to the strains lacking papi- <dig>
these results suggest that a papi- <dig> exclusion mechanism exists in p. aeruginosa that might serve to regulate the avoidance of uncontrolled expansions of the bacterial genome.
previous studies have shown that papi- <dig> encodes several putative virulence factors, including a major regulator of biofilm formation and antibiotic-resistance traits.
in this study, we performed a series of conjugation experiments and identified determinants of papi- <dig> acquisition by analyzing transfer efficiency between the donor and a series of mutant recipient strains.
our data show that common polysaccharide antigen  lipopolysaccharide , a homopolymer of d-rhamnose, is required for initiating papi- <dig> transfer, suggesting that this structure acts as a receptor for conjugative type iv pilus in recipient strains.
pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity island  <dig>  is one of the largest genomic islands of this important opportunistic human pathogen.
papi- <dig> is horizontally transferable into recipient strains lacking this island via conjugation mediated by the specialized type iv pilus.
