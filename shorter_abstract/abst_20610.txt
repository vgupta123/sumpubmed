the protein has 81% similarity with the bacterium thermotoga maritima ta.
the human ta gene is located at 17q <dig>  it contains two single nucleotide deletions, in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which cause frame-shifts and a premature in-frame stop codon towards the carboxy-terminal.
serine dehydratase-like  <dig> is a putative l-threonine catabolising enzyme.
almost all known functional residues are conserved between the two proteins including lys <dig> that forms a schiff-base with the cofactor, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate.
in mice, ta mrna was found at low levels in a range of adult tissues, being highest in prostate, heart and liver.
the cdna encodes a 400-residue protein.
it has been suggested that any detectable activity is due to serine hydroxymethyltransferase and that mammals lack a genuine threonine aldolase.
in contrast, serine/threonine dehydratase, another enzyme that catabolises l-threonine, is expressed very highly only in the liver.
expression of human ta mrna was undetectable by rt-pcr.
in whole mouse embryos ta mrna expression was low prior to e- <dig> increasing more than four-fold by e- <dig>
low levels of ta enzymatic activity have been found in vertebrates.
