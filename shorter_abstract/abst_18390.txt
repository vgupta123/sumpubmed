due to the inherent bias against membrane proteins in protein-protein interaction  data, interaction networks can be compromised particularly if they are to be used in conjunction with drug screening efforts, since most drug-targets are membrane proteins.
we also observed that the centrality-lethality rule depends on the content of membrane proteins in networks.
we show here that the bias against membrane proteins can and should be corrected in order to have a better representation of the interactions and topological properties of protein interaction networks.
the resulting less biased genome-scale network constructed for the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that the starvation pathway is a distinct subnetwork of autophagy and retrieved a more integrated network of unfolded protein response genes.
to overcome the experimental bias against ppis involving membrane-associated proteins we used a probabilistic approach based on a hypergeometric distribution followed by logistic regression to simultaneously optimize the weights of different sources of interaction data.
