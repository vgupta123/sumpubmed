the program clustdb proves that window alignment is an efficient way to find long sequence sections of homogenous alignment quality, as expected in case of random errors, and to detect systematic errors resulting from sequence contaminations.
such inserts are systematically overlooked in long alignments controlled by only tuning penalties for mismatches and gaps.
we therefore present a new algorithm for the identification of almost perfectly matching substrings in very large sets of sequences.
clustdb simultaneously generates large sets of exactly matching substrings of a given minimum length as seeds for a novel method of match extension with errors.
such alignments are not optimal in the usual sense but faster to calculate and often more appropriate than traditional alignments for genomic sequence comparisons, est and full-length cdna matching, and genomic sequence assembly.
