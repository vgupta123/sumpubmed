thus, in this work, we investigated the pain-related behavior response after mechanical noxious stimuli , and the activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase , an indicator of nos activity, within the dlpag of paradoxical sleep-deprived rats.
these data suggest that the hyperalgesic response to mechanical noxious stimuli in paradoxical sleep-deprived rats is associated with increased nos activity in the dlpag, which presumably influences the descending antinociceptive pathway.
l-name treatment prevented the reduction in the hindpaw withdrawal threshold  and the increase in the nadph-d positive cells number in the dlpag of psd-treated rats .
in addition, there were more nadph-d positive cells in dlpag after psd than in control rats .
both nitric oxide  and the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray matter  area of the brainstem are involved in hyperalgesia.
these data revealed that psd reduced the hindpaw withdrawal threshold  confirming the hyperalgesic effect of this condition.
the hyperalgesia observed after mechanical nociceptive stimulus is reversed through nitric oxide synthase  inhibition.
