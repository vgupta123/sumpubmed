at higher force levels, g/a subjects were able to generate more force per motor unit size suggesting more efficient motor unit function with increasing muscle force.
the two groups used motor units with different size and activation characteristics with increasing force generation.
while g/g subjects tended to utilize larger motor units with increasing force, g/a subjects showed relatively less increase in size by using relatively larger units at lower force levels.
the purpose of this study is to examine whether cntf genotype differentially affects motor unit activation in the vastus medialis with increasing isometric force during knee extension.
during the contractions, the vastus medialis was studied using surface and intramuscular electromyography with spiked triggered averaging to assess surface-detected motor unit potential  area and mean firing rates  from identified motor units.
differential motor unit responses were observed between cntf genotypes at force levels utilized in daily activities.
the effect of cntf on nerve development suggests that cntf genotype may be associated with force production via its influence on motor unit size and firing patterns.
ciliary neurotrophic factor  is important for neuronal and muscle development, and genetic variation in the cntf gene has been associated with muscle strength.
sixty-nine healthy subjects were genotyped for the presence of the g and a  alleles in the cntf gene .
the cntf g/a genotype was associated with smaller smup area motor units and lower mfr at higher force levels, and fewer but larger units at lower force levels than g/g homozygotes.
