in this report we suggest a mechanism by which orf <dig> protein of hev may inhibit host cell nf-κb activity during the course of a viral infection.
therefore, it has been a priority of many pathogens to manipulate the cellular nf-κb activity in order to create a favorable environment for their survival inside the host.
we observed that heterologous expression of the open reading frame  <dig>  protein in human hepatoma cells led to stabilization of the cellular i kappa b alpha  pool, with a concomitant reduction in the nuclear localization of the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb and inhibition of nf-κb activity.
nuclear factor kappa b  is a key transcription factor that plays a crucial role in host survival during infection by pathogens.
chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay of the proximal promoter regions of mhc-i heavy chain and il- <dig> genes using p <dig> antibody and lps stimulated orf <dig> expressing cell extract revealed decreased association of p <dig> with the above regions, indicating that orf <dig> inhibited p <dig> binding at endogenous promoters.
further analysis revealed that orf <dig> protein could directly associate with the f-box protein, beta transducin repeat containing protein  and orf <dig> over expression resulted in reduced association of iκbα with the skp <dig> and cul <dig> components of the scfβtrcp complex.
