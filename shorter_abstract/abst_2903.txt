orthologous relationship of the cesa and poales-specific cellulose synthase-like  genes among setaria italica , sorghum bicolor , oryza sativa , brachypodium distachyon  and hordeum vulgare  were compared using bioinformatics analysis.
the amounts of -β-glucan in setaria vegetative tissues ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % w/w with much smaller amounts in developing grain .
here the cellulose synthase  superfamily has been defined, with an emphasis on the amounts and distribution of -β-glucan, a cell wall polysaccharide that is characteristic of the grasses and is of considerable value for human health.
the cellulose synthase gene superfamily contains  <dig> cesa and  <dig> csl genes in setaria.
the characteristics of the cellulose synthase gene superfamily and the accumulation and distribution of -β-glucans in setaria are similar to those in other c <dig> grasses, including sorghum.

transcription profiling of csl gene families, which are involved in -β-glucan synthesis, was performed using real-time quantitative pcr .
the distribution and deposition of the mlg was examined using the specific antibody bg- <dig> and captured using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy .
the amount of -β-glucan was measured using a modified megazyme assay.
