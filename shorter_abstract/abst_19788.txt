these contigs were also annotated with gene ontology  and were found to cover a broad range of go categories.
the large est database generated from these sequences is an informative resource for identifying genes involved in various biological processes in carnation and provides an est resource for understanding the genetic diversity of this plant.
to increase our understanding of the genetic control of important characters in carnation, we generated an expressed sequence tag  database for a carnation cultivar important in horticulture by high-throughput sequencing using  <dig> pyrosequencing technology.
carnation , in the family caryophyllaceae, can be found in a wide range of colors and is a model system for studies of flower senescence.
however, few genomics resources, such as sequences and markers are available for carnation or other members of the caryophyllaceae.
transcripts were also identified for every step in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway.
transcripts were identified for almost every gene involved in flower chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolism and in anthocyanin biosynthesis.
furthermore, we identified  <dig>  potential simple sequence repeats  in  <dig>  of the unigenes.
we focused on gene discovery in the areas of flower color and ethylene biosynthesis.
we constructed a normalized cdna library and a 3â€™-utr library of carnation, obtaining a total of  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads.
