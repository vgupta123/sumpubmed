considering our improvement in measuring the sensitivity and the specificity of the tfs obtained from the chip-seq data, the models of transcriptional regulatory networks in embryonic cells and other cell types derived from the given chip-seq data should be carefully revised.
using available chip-seq data for eleven tfs, essential for self-maintenance and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells   reported in chen et al , we estimated  the specificity and the sensitivity of the chip-seq binding assays and  the number of specific but not identified in the current experiments binding sites  in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells.
within chip-seq data sets, the statistics of specific and non-specific dna-protein binding is defined by a mixture of sample size-dependent skewed functions described by kolmogorov-waring  function  and exponential function, respectively.
motif finding analysis applied to the identified c-myc tfbss supports our results and allowed us to predict many novel c-myc target genes.
transcription factor -dna binding loci are explored by analyzing massive datasets generated with application of chromatin immuno-precipitation -based high-throughput sequencing technologies.
therefore adequate mathematical models of chip-based high-throughput assay and statistical tools are required for a robust identification of specific and reliable tf binding sites , a precise characterization of tfbs avidity distribution and a plausible estimation the total number of specific tfbs for a given tf in the genome for a given cell type.
goodness-of fit analysis of k-w functions suggests that a large fraction of low- and moderate- avidity tfbss cannot be identified by the chip-based methods.
