synucleinopathies such as parkinson’s disease or multiple system atrophy are characterized by lewy bodies in distinct brain areas.
in summary, our results strengthen and further expand our knowledge about the line  <dig> mouse model, emphasizing this mouse model as a valuable in vivo tool to test new compounds directed against synucleinopathies.
while murine α-synuclein was also increased with age, it was lower expressed in line  <dig> mice than in non-transgenic littermates.
these aggregates are mainly formed by α-synuclein inclusions, a protein crucial for synaptic functions in the healthy brain.
our results show, that line  <dig> mice exhibited an age dependent increase of α-synuclein protein levels in the hippocampus but not the striatum.
here, we show an extended characterization of this mouse model over age.
transgenic animal models of synucleinopathies are frequently based on over-expression of human wild type or mutated α-synuclein under the regulatory control of different promoters.
