recent studies have indicated number of cholesterol independent actions of statins including their beneficial effects on vascular endothelial dysfunction and memory deficits associated with dementia of alzheimer's type.
therefore, the present study has been designed to investigate the effect of atorvastatin & pitavastatin on vascular endothelial dysfunction associated memory deficits in rats.
l-methionine produced endothelial dysfunction as reflected by significant decrease in serum nitrite concentration.
both atorvastatin as well as pitavastatin attenuated l-methionine induced endothelial dysfunction associated memory deficits.
these rats also showed a significant rise in brain oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase  activity and serum total cholesterol levels.
statins also reversed l-methionine induced rise in brain oxidative stress, ache activity and serum cholesterol.
in this study l-methionine induced vascular dementia was assessed by morris water-maze  test.
biochemical analysis was also performed to unfold possible mechanism of statins mediated modulation of vascular dementia.
the beneficial effects of statins may be attributed to their multiple effects and the study highlights the potential of these drugs in vascular dementia.
