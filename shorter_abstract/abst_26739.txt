we establish that p <dig> marks a similar se repertoire in embryonic stem cells as previously reported using med <dig> and h3k27ac.
our findings support the notion that p300-marked ses can help identify key nodes of transcriptional control during cell fate decisions.
transcriptional enhancers are frequently bound by a set of transcription factors that collaborate to activate lineage-specific gene expression.
the se landscape changes drastically during cell differentiation and cell activation.
