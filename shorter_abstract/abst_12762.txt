if trinucleotide microsatellites were encountered trough all part of est sequences, dinucleotide microsatellites were preferentially  concentrated in the 5' 100th nucleotides.
among  <dig> unigenes from a clementine est library, we have found at least one microsatellite sequence  in  <dig> unigenes .
furthermore, dinucleotide microsatellite markers were more polymorphic than trinucleotide ones, probably related to their distribution that was more often located in the 5' untranslated region .
whatever the position of the ssr in the ests the est-ssr markers we developed are powerful to investigate genetic diversity and genome mapping in citrus.
to end, the heterozygosity of each genotype and all dual combinations were studied to evaluate the percentage of mappable markers.
those gave higher levels of mappable markers  with a significant proportion suitable for synteny analysis.
we assessed the polymorphism of  <dig> est-ssr, by pcr amplification droved with flanking primers among ten citrus species plus  <dig> from other genera.
we obtained a good agreement of diversity relationships between the citrus species and relatives assessed with est-ssr markers with the established taxonomy and phylogeny.
to optimize the use of these est-ssrs as genetic markers in genome mapping programs and citrus systematic analysis, we have investigated their polymorphism related to the type  or their position in the coding sequences.
more than 90% of est-ssr markers were polymorphic.
fourty one new est-ssr markers were produced and were available for citrus genetic studies.
