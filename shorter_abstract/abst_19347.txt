we applied the procedure to time-course electrophoretic data produced by hicep, an aflp-based expression profiling method which can detect a slight expression change in dna fragments.
it then constructs the optimal normalized pattern whose correlation coefficient against the reference in the range achieves the highest value among various combinations of candidates.
the current normalization strategy based on molecular weight markers has limited accuracy because marker peaks are often masked by intense peaks nearby.
the normalization strategy presented here demonstrates the importance of pre-processing before electrophoretic signal comparison, and we anticipate its usefulness especially for temporal expression analysis by the electrophoretic method.
cumulative errors in fragment lengths cause problems in the alignment of same-length fragments across different electropherograms, especially for small fragments .
gene expression analysis based on comparison of electrophoretic patterns is strongly dependent on the accuracy of dna fragment sizing.
for accurate comparison of electrophoretic patterns, further inspection and normalization of electrophoretic data after fragment sizing by conventional strategies is needed.
we obtained dissimilar ranges whose electrophoretic patterns were obviously different from the reference and as expected, most of the fragments in the detected ranges were short .
the normalized electrophoretic patterns also agreed well with reference patterns.
here we describe a method for the normalization of a set of time-course electrophoretic data to be compared.
