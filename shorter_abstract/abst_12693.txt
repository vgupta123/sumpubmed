the quantification of metabolites across samples, becoming a major bottleneck.
the package is written in the r programming language with computationally intensive functions written in c for speed and performance.
we introduce the targetsearch package, an open source tool which is a flexible and accurate method for pre-processing even very large numbers of gc-ms samples within hours.
the package includes a graphical user interface to allow easy use by those unfamiliar with r.
we developed a novel strategy to iteratively correct and update retention time indices for searching and identifying metabolites.
