with the advent of microarray technology, it has become feasible to identify virtually all genes in an organism that are induced by developmental or environmental changes.
thus, gene targets for the entire tf gene families were predicted.
development of computational methods to combine microarray data with other information sources is therefore necessary.
by means of our method, previously published arabidopsis microarray data from cold acclimated plants at six different time points, promoter motif sequence data extracted from ~ <dig>  arabidopsis promoters and known transcription factor binding sites were combined to construct a putative genetic regulatory interaction network.
on the other hand, since our method highlights putative novel interactions, more directed experiments could now be performed.
however, it should be noted that information on specific binding sites for individual tfs were in most cases not available.
we tested the method on the cold acclimation process in arabidopsis and could identify a more complex putative genetic regulatory network than previously described.
however, relying solely on gene expression data may be of limited value if the aim is to infer the underlying genetic networks.
