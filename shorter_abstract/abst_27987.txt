transgenic rice plants over-expressing ospub <dig> at early stage displayed cell death lesions spontaneously in association with a constitutive activation of plant basal defense responses, including excessive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, up-regulated expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to blast strains.
these results reveal that the e <dig> ligase ospub <dig> interacts directly with the receptor-like kinase pid <dig> and regulates plant cell death and blast disease resistance.
we found that ospub <dig> physically interacted with the kinase domain of pid <dig>  in vitro and in vivo and the arm repeat domain of ospub <dig> was essential for the interaction.
we previously cloned the rice blast resistance gene pid <dig>  which encodes a transmembrane receptor-like kinase containing an extracellular b-lectin domain and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain.
in vitro biochemical assays indicated that pid2k possessed kinase activity and was able to phosphorylate ospub <dig>  we also found that the phosphorylated form of ospub <dig> possessed e <dig> ligase activity.
rice blast disease is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide.
we also observed that, along with plant growth, the cell death lesions kept spreading over the whole seedlings quickly resulting in a seedling lethal phenotype.
