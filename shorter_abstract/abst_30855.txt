the purpose of this study was to define whether the aurora a-hp1γ pathway supports cell division of gametes and/or early embryos, using western blot, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, shrna-based knockdown, site-directed mutagenesis, and affymetrix-based genome-wide expression profiles.
in addition, disruption in this pathway causes centrosomal abnormalities and aberrations in cell division.
these results support the idea that phosphorylation of hp1γ by aurora a plays a role in the regulation of gene expression and mitotic cell division in cells from the sperm lineage and in early embryos.
combined, this data is relevant to better understanding the function of hp1γ in reproductive biology.
expression profiling of male germ cell lines demonstrates that hp1γ phosphorylation is critical for the regulation of mitosis-associated gene expression networks.
hp1γ, a well-known regulator of gene expression, has been recently identified to be a target of aurora a, a mitotic kinase which is important for both gametogenesis and embryogenesis.
