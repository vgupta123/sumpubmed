we also describe uncommon positioning of binding motifs for several t-cell lineage specific factors in human promoters.
our proposed di-nucleotide pwm approach outperforms the conventional mono-nucleotide pwm approach with respect to gata- <dig>  therefore our new di-nucleotide pwm provides new insight into plausible transcriptional regulatory interactions in human promoters.
the present work implements the optimization algorithm applied to the existing pwm for gata- <dig> transcription factor and builds a new di-nucleotide pwm.
because of the importance of in silico mapping of tentative binding sites, we previously developed an approach for pwm optimization that substantially improves the accuracy of such mapping.
the identifying of binding sites for transcription factors is a key component of gene regulatory network analysis.
