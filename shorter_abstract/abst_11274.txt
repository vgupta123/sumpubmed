the assembly of the bread wheat genome sequence is challenging due to allohexaploidy and extreme repeat content .
the effect of mp data integration into pair end shotgun assemblies of wheat chromosome was moderate; possibly due to poor contig assembly contiguity, the extreme repeat content of wheat, and the use of amplified chromosomal dna for mp library construction.
the aim of this work was to assess how mate pair data generated from multiple displacement amplified dna of flow-sorted chromosomes affect assembly fragmentation of shotgun assemblies of the wheat chromosomes.
isolation of single chromosome arms by flow sorting can be used to overcome the polyploidy problem, but the repeat content cause extreme assembly fragmentation even at a single chromosome level.
long jump paired sequencing data  can help reduce assembly fragmentation by joining multiple contigs into single scaffolds.
furthermore, a strong positive correlation between estimated scaffold reliability and scaffold assembly stringency was observed.
three mate pair  libraries  were sequenced to a total coverage of 89x and 64x for the short and long arm of chromosome 7b, respectively.
a 7bs scaffold assembly with reduced mp coverage proved that assembly contiguity was affected only to a small degree down to ~50% of the original coverage.
scaffolding using sspace improved the 7b assembly contiguity and decreased gene space fragmentation, but the degree of improvement was greatly affected by scaffolding stringency applied.
