for a better understanding of the insulin effect on the central nervous system, we performed microarray-based global gene expression profiling in the hippocampus, striatum and prefrontal cortex of streptozotocin-induced and spontaneously diabetic goto-kakizaki rats as model animals for type  <dig> and type  <dig> diabetes, respectively.
these gene lists proved to be partly overlapping and encompassed genes related to neurotransmission, lipid metabolism, neuronal development, insulin secretion, oxidative damage and dna repair.
galanin receptor  <dig>  protein kinase c gamma and epsilon, abca <dig> , cd <dig>  and the ret  protooncogene, were found to exhibit altered expression levels in type  <dig> diabetic model animals in comparison to non-diabetic control animals.
following pathway analysis and validation of gene lists by real-time polymerase chain reaction,  <dig> genes from the hippocampus, such as the inhibitory neuropeptide galanin, synuclein gamma and uncoupling protein  <dig>  and  <dig> genes from the prefrontal cortex, e.g.
there has been an increasing body of epidemiologic and biochemical evidence implying the role of cerebral insulin resistance in alzheimer-type dementia.
changes in the cerebral gene expression profiles seemed to be specific for the type  <dig> diabetic model, as no such alterations were found in streptozotocin-treated animals.
