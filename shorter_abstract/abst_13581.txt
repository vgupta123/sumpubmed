to determine the causes for the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions, we compared the pepper genome to that of tomato.
the fish analysis of the pepper tat elements showed a random distribution in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, whereas the tomato tat elements showed heterochromatin-preferential accumulation.
phylogenetic comparison of the ltr retrotransposons revealed that two groups of ty3/gypsy-like elements  were overly accumulated in the pepper genome.
compared to tomato pepper euchromatin doubled its size by differential accumulation of a specific group of ty3/gypsy-like elements.
the comparative analysis of orthologous gene-rich regions between both species revealed insertion of transposons exclusively in the pepper sequences, maintaining the gene order and content.
for sequence-level analysis, we generated  <dig>  mb of pepper genomic sequences from euchromatin enriched  <dig>  pepper bac clones.
our results could provide an insight on the mechanism of genome evolution in the solanaceae family.
among the solanaceae plants, the pepper genome is three times larger than that of tomato.
although the gene repertoire and gene order of both species are well conserved, the cause of the genome-size difference is not known.
