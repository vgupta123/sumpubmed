in this study we provide mirnas profile of gc where many mirnas showed aberrant expression from normal tissues, suggesting their involvement in the development and progression of gastric cancer.
after candidate mirnas were selected, rt-qpcr further confirmed that four mirnas  were significantly aberrant in gc tissues compared to the normal gastric tissues.
we have used mirna microarray analysis and validated the results by real-time quantitative pcr .
in conclusion, our results suggest that mir-200c-3p had potential to use as diagnostic biomarker for distinguishing gc patients from normal individuals and can be used for diagnosis of cancer at early stage.

however, its expression studies have never been performed in gastric cancer  patients from saudi population.
first time this study was conducted to identify mirnas that are differentially expressed in gc patients compared with normal controls.
we investigated the role of mirnas in gc patients using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tissues of  <dig> samples from gc patients  and  <dig> from normal control.
only  <dig> mirnas had significant expression in early and late-stage cancer tissues.
