testicular tumors are the most common genital neoplasms in male dogs, with leydig cell tumors , seminomas , and sertoli cell tumors  the most common forms.
igcnu was found in 3% of testicles at necropsy and in 3% of biopsy samples.
tumor incidence in biopsy samples, dog age, and histological classification were consistent with previous studies.
the higher incidence of sem and sct in the biopsy group probably resulted from the obvious clinical expression of these tumor types.
testicular tumors were found in 46% of dogs at necropsy and accounted for 7% of tumors biopsied.
cytokeratin helps differentiate stromal tumors, especially sct, from germ cell tumors.
histology and c-kit and plap expression indicate that igcnu exists in dogs.
expression of c-kit was most common in sem and seminomatous components of mixed tumors.
the aim of this study was to verify that csem/ssem classification is valid in dogs and confirm the existence of canine igcnu.
the most common tumors, in decreasing order, were lct, mixed tumors, sem and sct at necropsy, and sem, sct, mixed tumors, lct, peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and teratoma in the biopsy group.
intratubular germ cell neoplasia of undifferentiated origin  is another form of human testicular tumor.
low cd <dig> expression confirmed the low incidence of testicular embryonal carcinoma.
