we also used methpat to describe epiallelic dna methylation within the mitochondrial genome.
true representation of methylation patterns can only be fully characterised by clonal analysis.
deep sequencing provides the ability to investigate clonal dna methylation patterns in unprecedented detail and scale, enabling the proper characterisation of the heterogeneity of methylation patterns.
we have developed a new analysis and visualisation software tool “methpat”, that extracts and displays clonal dna methylation patterns from massively parallel sequencing data aligned using bismark.
unlike currently available tools, methpat can visualise the diversity of epiallelic dna methylation patterns in a sample.
methpat can summarise and visualise epiallelic dna methylation results from targeted amplicon, massively parallel sequencing of bisulfite converted dna in a compact and interpretable format.
dna methylation at a gene promoter region has the potential to regulate gene transcription.
this complexity is commonly obscured when dna methylation data is summarised as an average percentage value for each cpg site .

patterns of methylation over multiple cpg sites in a region are often complex and cell type specific, with the region showing multiple allelic patterns in a sample.
