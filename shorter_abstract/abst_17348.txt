studies of phylogenetically basal invertebrates such as corals will further elucidate the fundamental functional aspects of gene body methylation in metazoa.

in invertebrates, genes belonging to dynamically regulated functional categories appear to be less methylated than “housekeeping” genes, suggesting that dna methylation may modulate gene expression plasticity.
to date, however, experimental evidence to support this hypothesis across different natural habitats has been lacking.
gene expression profiles were generated from  <dig> pairs of genetically identical fragments of coral acropora millepora reciprocally transplanted between distinct natural habitats for 3 months.
genes with weak methylation signatures were more likely to demonstrate differential expression based on both transplant environment and population of origin than genes with strong methylation signatures.
our results support a connection between differential germline methylation and gene expression flexibility across environments and populations.
gene expression was analyzed in the context of normalized cpg content, a well-established signature of historical germline dna methylation.
