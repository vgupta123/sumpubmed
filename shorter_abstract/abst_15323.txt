in hek <dig> cells transfected with murine or human tlrs, cd <dig>  and md- <dig>  heat-killed b. pseudomallei activated tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  b. pseudomallei lps and lipid a activated tlr <dig> and this tlr4-mediated signaling required md- <dig>  in tlr2-/- macrophages, stimulation with heat-killed b. pseudomallei augmented tnf-α and mip- <dig> production whereas in tlr4-/- cells, tnf-α, mip- <dig>  and il- <dig> production was reduced.
although the macrophage cytokine response to b. pseudomallei lps or lipid a is completely dependent on tlr <dig>  in tlr2-/- macrophages stimulated with b. pseudomallei, b. pseudomallei lps or lipid a, cytokine production is augmented.
overall mortality approaches 40% yet little is known about mechanisms of host defense.
these findings provide new insights into critical mechanisms of host defense in melioidosis.
cytokine production by macrophages stimulated with b. pseudomallei lps or lipid a was entirely dependent on tlr <dig> but was increased in the absence of tlr <dig>  tlr adaptor molecule myd <dig> strongly regulated tnf-α production in response to heat-killed b. pseudomallei.
melioidosis, a lethal tropical infection that is endemic in southeast asia and northern australia, is caused by the saprophytic gram-negative bacterium burkholderia pseudomallei.
other myd88-dependent signaling pathways may also be important in the host response to b. pseudomallei infection.
toll-like receptors  are host transmembrane receptors that recognize conserved pathogen molecular patterns and induce an inflammatory response.
we examined tlr signaling induced by b. pseudomallei, b. pseudomallei lps, and b. pseudomallei lipid a using gain-of-function transfection assays of nf-κb activation and studies of tlr-deficient macrophages.
