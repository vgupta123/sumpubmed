analyses focused on the metazoa suggest an elaborate bzip network was in place in the most recent shared ancestor of all extant animals that was comprised of  <dig> of the  <dig> previously recognized families present in modern taxa.
our results reveal the ancestral opisthokont, holozoan and metazoan bzip repertoire and provide insights into the progressive expansion and divergence of bzips in the five main eukaryotic kingdoms, suggesting thatÂ the early diversification of bzips in multiple eukaryotic lineages was a prerequisite for the evolution of complex multicellular organisms.
bzips are also involved in stress responses and the regulation of cell proliferation in fungi, amoebozoans and heterokonts.
thus the ancestral metazoan and eumetazoan bzip repertoire consists of  <dig> and  <dig> bzips, respectively.
bzip family diversification is largely restricted to multicellular lineages, consistent with bzips contributing to the complex regulatory networks underlying differential and cell type-specific gene expression in these lineages.
amongst the conserved eukaryotic transcription factor families, the basic leucine zipper  superfamily is one of the most ancient and best characterised.
in addition this analysis identifies three bzip families that appear to have been lost in mammals.
in all cases, this required an elaboration of the regulatory mechanisms controlling gene expression.
this gene family plays a diversity of roles in the specification, differentiation and maintenance of cell types in plants and animals.
