these results demonstrate the feasibility of a maldi-tof approach for the analysis of cd4+ lipid extracts and suggest how alterations in the lipid metabolism characterized lymphocytes of ms patients.
in this study, a lipidomic analysis was performed for the rapid profile of cd4+ t lymphocytes from ms patient and control samples in an untargeted approach.
the analysis reveals some modifications in the phospholipid pattern of ms cd4+ t lymphocytes with respect to healthy controls with a significant increase of cardiolipin species in ms samples.
lipids were analyzed in negative mode and selected species fragmented using maldi tandem mass spectrometry for their structural assignments.
lipids play different important roles in central nervous system so that dysregulation of lipid pathways has been implicated in a growing
