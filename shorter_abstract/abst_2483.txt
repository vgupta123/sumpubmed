we propose that the male sterility in the new loco mutants result from a failure of accurate morphogenesis of the adult reproductive system during metamorphosis, we propose that this is due to a loss of expression of loco c <dig>  thus, we conclude that specific isoforms of loco are required for the differentiation of the male gonad and genital disc.
we identified a number of lethal loco mutants and four semi-lethal lines, which generate males with reduced fertility.
less is known about loco and its involvement in male development therefore to gain further insight into the role of loco in development we carried out a genetic screen and analysed males with reduced fertility.
we have characterised the expression pattern of all loco transcripts during pupal development in the adult testes, both in wild type and loco mutant strains.
we have identified a fifth loco transcript and show that it is differentially expressed in developing pupae.
