a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated ribosomal associated loci supported separate evolutionary paths for b. abortus, b. melitensis, and b. suis/b.
polymorphisms identified among ribosome associated loci construct a robust phylogenetic tree supporting classical brucella spp.
efflux plays an important role in brucella sensitivity to erythromycin.
erythromycin mic values of reference and all eryr strains, except the b. suis eryr mutants, were lowered variably by paβn.
though brucella ovis was clustered with b. abortus, the bootstrap value was low.
polymorphisms among ribosomal loci from the reference brucella do not correlate with their highly differential susceptibility to erythromycin.
when spontaneous erythromycin resistant  mutants were examined, mutation of the peptidyl transferase center  correlated with increased resistance to both erythromycin and clindamycin.
minimum inhibitory concentration  values of brucella reference strains and three marine isolates to antibiotics binding the ribosome ranged from  <dig>  to > <dig> μg/ml for the macrolides erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin and  <dig> to > <dig> μg/ml for the lincosamide, clindamycin.
differences found among other conserved ribosomal loci could further define the relationships among the classical brucella spp.
though sequence polymorphisms were identified among ribosome associated loci 23s rrn, rplv, tuf- <dig> and tuf- <dig> but not rpld, they did not correlate with antibiotic resistance phenotypes.
canis, clustering marine brucella and b. neotomae with b. melitensis.
however, they have important phenotypic differences such as differential susceptibility to antibiotics binding the ribosome.
