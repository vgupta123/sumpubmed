these bystander cd4+ and cd8+t cells had similar kinetics to nk cells, appeared after  <dig> h and were inhibited by anti-il- <dig> neutralization indicating cytokine involvement.
the major ifn-γ sources were natural killer  , cd4+t  and cd8+t cells , respectively, as demonstrated by four-color flow cytometry.
however, bystander t cell activation, which is tcr independent, occurs via cytokines in other viral infections, both in vitro and in vivo, and enables t cells to bypass certain control checkpoints.
this study described immune cell profiles and highlighted bystander t cell activation in response to dengue viral antigens of healthy people in an endemic area.
further studies on bystander t cell activation in dengue viral infection may reveal the immune mechanisms that protect or enhance pathogenesis of secondary dengue infection.
elisa results revealed that approximately 72% of ifn-γ production occurred via the tcr-dependent pathway.
whole blood samples from  <dig> thai schoolchildren aged 13- <dig> years were assayed for in vitro interferon-gamma  induction in response to inactivated dengue serotype  <dig> antigen .
previous studies of t cell activation in dengue infection have focused on restriction of specific t cell receptors  and classical mhc molecules.
the contribution of tcr-dependent and independent pathways was tested by treatment with cyclosporin a , which inhibits tcr-dependent activation of t cells.
interestingly, in addition to these cells, we found csa-resistant ifn-γ producing t cells  implying the existence of activated bystander t cells in response to dengue antigen in vitro.
