importantly, pcr with dna primers yielded significantly higher amplification efficiencies of biological samples than a similar method based on locked nucleic acids-spiked primers, which is in agreement with the observation that locked nucleic acid interferes with efficient amplification of short templates.
the higher amplification efficiency of dna primers translates into higher sensitivity and precision in microrna quantification.
due to the important biological role it is of great interest to quantitatively determine their expression level in different biological settings.
micrornas are important regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play an important role in many biological processes.
we describe a pcr method for quantification of micrornas based on a single reverse transcription reaction for all micrornas combined with real-time pcr with two, microrna-specific dna primers.
mir-specific quantitative rt-pcr with dna primers is a highly specific, sensitive and accurate method for microrna quantification.
primer annealing temperatures were optimized by adding a dna tail to the primers and could be designed with a success rate of 94%.
