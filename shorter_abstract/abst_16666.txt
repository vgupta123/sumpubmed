support vector machine  based models have been developed using binary pattern of amino acid sequence of protein and achieved maximum accuracy  <dig> % with mathew's correlation coefficient   <dig>  and area under curve   <dig> .
we also developed a web server which predicts fad interacting residues in a protein which is freely available for academics.
the performance of these models have been improved significantly from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with mcc  <dig>  and auc  <dig> , when evolutionary information is used as input in svm.
the evolutionary information was generated in form of position specific score matrix  profile by using psi-blast at e-value  <dig> .
this study suggests that evolutionary information of  <dig> amino acid patterns perform best for fad interacting residues prediction.
