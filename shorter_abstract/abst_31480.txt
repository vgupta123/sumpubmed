gene flow between regions was predominantly east-to-west and was only moderate, with higher heterozygote deficiency where the two lineages co-occur.
we investigated genetic differentiation, contemporary patterns of demographic connectivity and intraspecific variation of adaptive behavioural traits in two lineages of an intertidal mussel  across a tropical/subtropical biogeographic transition.
microsatellite analyses revealed clear genetic differentiation between western  and eastern  populations, confirming divergence previously detected with mitochondrial  and nuclear  markers.
common garden experiments showed that gaping  and attachment to the substratum differed significantly between the two lineages.
this can be explained by differential selection and/or oceanographic dynamics acting as a barrier to larval dispersal.
