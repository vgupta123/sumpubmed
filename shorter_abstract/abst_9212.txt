the maximal l-dopa was produced  at  <dig> % potassium dihydrogen phosphate with l-tyrosine consumption of  <dig>  mg/ml.
the culture a. niger  was propagated in  <dig> ml erlenmeyer flasks and the pre-grown mycelia  were used in the reaction mixture as a source of enzyme tyrosinase.
the results are highly significant  and mark the commercial utility  of the mould culture which is perhaps the first ever report on l-dopa production from a. niger.
aspergillus oryzae is commonly used for l-dopa production; however, a slower growth rate and relatively lower tyrosinase activity of mycelia have led to an increasing interest in exploiting alternative fungal cultures.
grinded mycelia gave  <dig>  fold higher l-dopa production compared to the intact at 6% glucose .
over ~73% yield was achieved  when the process parameters were identified using 2k-plackett-burman experimental design.
among the various nitrogen sources,  <dig> % peptone, 1% yeast extract and  <dig> % ammonium chloride were optimized.
the rate of l-tyrosine consumption was improved from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/ml.
