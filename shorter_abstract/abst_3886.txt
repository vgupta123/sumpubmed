as a way of promoting potential, alternative applications of the methodology presented, an example of exploratory data analysis of interactome networks is illustrated.
such approaches should satisfy the following factors: support for intuitive cluster visualisation, user-friendly and robust application, computational efficiency and generation of biologically meaningful outcomes.
this study indicates that such a system may represent a user-friendly and robust approach to exploratory data analysis.
a relaxation method for non-linear mapping provided the basis for visualisation-driven analyses using different types of data.
the method distinguished relevant clusters and critical analysis areas.
results suggest that this method might represent an effective solution for detecting key network hubs and for clustering biologically meaningful groups of proteins.
this research assesses a relaxation method for non-linear mapping that addresses these concerns.
it may allow users to gain better insights into the underlying data structure, detect potential outliers and assess assumptions about the cluster composition of the data.
its applications to gene expression and protein-protein interaction data analyses are investigated
publicly available expression data originating from leukaemia, round blue-cell tumours and parkinson disease studies were analysed.
