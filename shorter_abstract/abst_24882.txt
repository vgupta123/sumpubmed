the morphogenic mechanisms by which the ductal network is established as well as the signaling pathways involved in this process are poorly understood.
in conclusion, our data show that the primitive pancreatic ductal network, which is lined by a monolayered and polarized epithelium, forms by remodeling of a globular mass of non polarized epithelial cells.
during the first transition, the monolayered and polarized endodermal cells give rise to tissue buds composed of a mass of non polarized epithelial cells.
reorganization of a globular mass of epithelial cells in polarized monolayers is also observed during submandibular glands development.
reorganization of cultured pancreatic buds into monolayered epithelia was blocked in the presence of amd <dig>  a sdf- <dig> antagonist.
by morphological analyzis of wild-type and mutant mouse embryos and using cultured embryonic explants we investigated how epithelial morphogenesis takes place and is regulated by chemokine signaling.
the exocrine pancreas is composed of a branched network of ducts connected to acini.
pancreas ontogenesis displayed a sequence of two opposite epithelial transitions.
analyzis of sdf <dig> and cxcr <dig> knockout embryos at the stage of the second epithelial transition revealed transient defective morphogenesis of the ventral and dorsal pancreas.
our data also suggest that sdf- <dig> controls the branching morphogenesis of several exocrine tissues.
during the second transition the buds reorganize into branched and polarized epithelial monolayers that further differentiate into tubulo-acinar glands.
