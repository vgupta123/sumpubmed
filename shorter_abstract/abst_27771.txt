the program aims at a non-expert audience in terms of computer skills; the combination of new functionalities makes the program flexible and useful for a broad range of operations.
the blastgrabber application introduces new ways of visualizing and analysing massive blast output data by integrating taxonomy identification, text mining capabilities and generic multi-dimensional rendering of blast hits.
query names and fasta headers can be analysed by text-mining.
few programs attempt to directly visualize and interpret blast output; those that do often provide a mere basic structuring of blast data.
in addition to visualizing sequence alignments, blast data can be ordered as an interactive taxonomy tree.
however, the raw blast output from contemporary searches involving thousands of queries becomes ill-suited for direct human processing.
text or xml-formatted blast output files can be directly imported, displayed and categorized based on blast statistics.
the blast algorithm remains the main search engine for retrieving sequence information, and must consequently handle data on an unprecedented scale.
