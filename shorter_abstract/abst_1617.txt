for investigating genetic diversity and the extent of linkage disequilibrium  we analyzed eleven candidate genes and  <dig> microsatellite markers in  <dig> lines from five eastern and middle european rye populations.
snps discovered in the promoters or coding regions, which attribute to non-synonymous substitutions, are suitable candidates for association mapping.
the middle european population did not differ substantially from the four eastern european populations in terms of haplotype frequencies or in the level of nucleotide diversity.
according to an analysis of molecular variance , most of the genetic variation was found between individuals within populations.
a total of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and nine insertion-deletion polymorphisms were found within  <dig>  bp of dna sequence from eleven candidate genes, resulting in an average snp frequency of  <dig> snp/ <dig> bp.
sccbf <dig>  scvrn <dig>  and scdhn <dig> were dominated by a single haplotype, while the other  <dig> genes  had a more balanced haplotype frequency distribution.
nucleotide and haplotype diversity of candidate genes were high with average values π =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and hd =  <dig> , respectively.
haplotype frequencies varied markedly between the candidate genes.
the low ld in rye compared to self-pollinating species promises a high resolution in genome-wide association mapping.
