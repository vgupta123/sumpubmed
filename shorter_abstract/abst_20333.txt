have introduced a likelihood ratio test statistic for two-sample situations that has desirable theoretical properties , but uses standard fdr assessment; ploner et al.
for both simulated and real datasets, fdr2d performs better than odp.
using simulated and real datasets, we compare the odp and fdr2d procedures.
we also introduce a new procedure called s2d that combines the odp test statistic with the extended fdr assessment of fdr2d.
the relationship and relative performance of these methods in two-sample comparisons is currently unknown.
the new procedure s2d performs as well as fdr2d on simulated data, but performs better on the real data sets.
the new procedure s2d has a slight advantage over fdr2d, which has to be balanced against a significantly higher computational effort and a less intuititive test statistic.
due to multiple testing considerations, the false discovery rate  is the key tool for assessing the significance of these test statistics.
have introduced a multivariate local fdr that allows incorporation of standard error information, but uses the standard t-statistic .
as expected, both methods perform better than a standard t-statistic with standard local fdr.
