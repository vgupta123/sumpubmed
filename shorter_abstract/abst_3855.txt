the results revealed the presence of admixture among the ugandan, rwandan, and kuroiler populations.
the survival and subsequent evolution within these local environments can be the result of both natural and artificial selection driving the acquisition of favorable traits, which over time leave genomic signatures in a population.
the study suggests that these populations have alleles under selective pressure from their environment, which may aid in adaptation to harsh environments.
indigenous chickens from uganda  and rwanda , plus kuroilers , were genotyped using the axiom® 600 k chicken genotyping array.
genes within runs of homozygosity consensus regions are linked to gene ontology  terms related to lipid metabolism, immune functions and stress-mediated responses .
