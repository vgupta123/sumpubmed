spiedw is a web tool designed to facilitate fast and simple quantitative querying of publically available gene expression data.
gene expression data for over  <dig>  experiments across multiple species and platforms have been collected into a searchable database.
it is hoped that this will open up gene expression data mining to the wider research community.
secondly, spiedw has an enhanced search algorithm for speedy web-based querying and lastly an abridged dataset comprising the most regulated genes has been included for a speedier search and searching for enrichment of gene sets.
the resource is motivated by the observation that transcriptional profiles can serve as effective means of comparing biological states across a wide set of experiments.
spiedw features three significant improvements over the original version.
