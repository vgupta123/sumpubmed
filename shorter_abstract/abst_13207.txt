the guppy, poecilia reticulata, is a well-known model organism for studying inheritance and variation of male ornamental traits as well as adaptation to different river habitats.
about  <dig>  ests were annotated according to blastn and blastx results and the sequence information from the 3' utrs was exploited to generate pcr primers for re-sequencing of genomic dna from different wild type strains.
by comparison of est-linked genomic sequences from at least four different ecotypes, about  <dig>  polymorphisms were identified, representing about  <dig> distinct genes.
