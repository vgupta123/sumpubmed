a web server has been developed based on svm models described in this study .
furthermore, when integrating the secondary structure features with binary pattern, an accuracy of  <dig>  was seen.
this study demonstrates that guide and passenger strand of mirna precursors can be distinguished using their nucleotide sequence and secondary structure.
secondly, models were developed using split nucleotide composition and achieved maximum accuracies of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide respectively.
in addition, we also compared the performance of our method with various sirna-designing methods on mirna and sirna datasets.
moreover, the performance of this model was tested on an independent dataset that achieved an accuracy of  <dig> .
in this study, first time a method has been developed to predict guide mirna strands, of mirna duplex.
one strand of the duplex, which incorporates into rna-induced silencing complex  and silences the gene expression is called guide strand, or mirna; while the other strand of duplex is degraded and called the passenger strand, or mirna*.
firstly, models were developed using mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide composition of mirna strands and achieved the highest accuracies of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.
finally, hybrid models were developed by combining various features and achieved maximum accuracy of  <dig>  with sensitivity  <dig>  and specificity  <dig> .
thirdly, models were developed using binary pattern and achieved the highest accuracy of  <dig> .
