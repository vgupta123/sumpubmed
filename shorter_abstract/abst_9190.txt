dynamics on several levels, from molecular pathways to tissue growth, are seamlessly integrated.
expert knowledge in journal articles is an important source of data for reconstructing biological pathways and creating new hypotheses.
researchers traditionally use mental models of pathways to integrate information and development new hypotheses.
intelligent hybrid systems, which refers to several related computing methods such as fuzzy logic, neural nets, genetic algorithms, and statistical analysis, has become ubiquitous in engineering applications for complex control system modeling and design.
an important need for medical research is to integrate this data with high throughput sources to build useful models that span several scales.
this paper presents the algorithmic methods needed for modeling complicated biochemical dynamics using rule-based models to represent expert knowledge in the context of cell cycle regulation and tumor growth.
a new modeling approach based on these methods is presented in the context of hedgehog regulation of the cell cycle in granule cells.
a number of common network motifs are examined and used to build a model of hedgehog regulation of the cell cycle in cerebellar neurons, which is believed to play a key role in the etiology of medulloblastoma, a devastating childhood brain cancer.
biological pathways may be considered to be complex control systems, which medicine tries to manipulate to achieve desired results.
a novel approach for biological pathway modeling based on hybrid intelligent systems or soft computing technologies is presented here.
thus, hybrid intelligent systems may provide a useful tool for modeling biological system dynamics and computational exploration of new drug targets.

unfortunately, the amount of information is often overwhelming and these are inadequate for predicting the dynamic response of complex pathways.
