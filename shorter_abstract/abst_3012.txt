among vibrio species in the genome database, we identified  <dig> putative rdfs within regions that also encoded intv <dig> homologues.
we determined the conditions and the factors that affect excision of vpi- <dig> in v. cholerae n <dig>  we demonstrate that excision from chromosome  <dig> is induced at low temperature and after sublethal uv-light irradiation treatment.
in addition, after uv-light irradiation compared to untreated cells, cells showed increased expression of three genes, intv <dig> , and two putative recombination directionality factors , vefa  and vefb  encoded within vpi- <dig>  we demonstrate that along with intv <dig>  the rdf vefa is essential for excision.
vibrio pathogenicity island- <dig>  is a  <dig> kb region present in choleragenic v. cholerae isolates that is required for growth on sialic acid as a sole carbon source.
v. cholerae non-o1/o <dig> pathogenic strains also contain vpi- <dig>  which in addition to sialic acid catabolism genes also encodes a type  <dig> secretion system in these strains.
we constructed a knockout mutant of vefa in v. cholerae n <dig>  and found that no excision of vpi- <dig> occurred, indicating that a functional vefa gene is required for excision.
we demonstrate that excision of vpi- <dig> is induced under some environmental stress conditions and we show for the first time that an rdf encoded within a pathogenicity island in v. cholerae is required for excision of the region.
