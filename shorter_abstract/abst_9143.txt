this analysis shows that in the nos- <dig> gene promoter the position and the evolutionary divergence of some conserved regions are different in rodents and non-rodent mammals, and in particular in primates.
transcription from the promoters of these genes is very dependent on nf-κb activation, which integrates the response to diverse extracellular stresses.
two not previously described distal regions in rodents that are similar to the unique upstream region responsible of the nf-κb activation of nos- <dig> in humans are fragmented and translocated to different locations in the rodent promoters.
the majority of the genes involved in the inflammatory response are highly conserved in mammals.
