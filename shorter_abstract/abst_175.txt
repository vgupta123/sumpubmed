several of the differentially expressed genes were known to be important for pancreatic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation whereas others have not previously been associated with pancreatic development.
quantitative real-time rt-pcr analyses and immunohistochemical analyses also revealed that the expression of fgfr2iiib, that encodes the receptor for fgf <dig>  was down-regulated in ipf1/pdx1-/- pancreatic progenitor cells.
microarray analyses identified a total of  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in e <dig>  pancreatic buds of ipf1/pdx1-/- embryos.
this microarray analysis has identified a number of candidate genes that are differentially expressed in ipf1/pdx1-/- pancreatic buds.
the expression of one of these, spondin  <dig>  which encodes an extracellular matrix protein, has not previously been described in the pancreas.
although several putative target genes have been linked to the Î²-cell function of ipf1/pdx <dig>  relatively little is known with respect to genes regulated by ipf1/pdx <dig> in early pancreatic progenitor cells.
