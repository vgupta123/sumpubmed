these x chromosome ancestral components experienced a series of fusion and breakage events to give rise to avian autosomes and mammalian sex chromosomes.
this study clarifies the genesis and remodelling of the eutherian x chromosome by using a combination of sequence analysis, meiotic map information, and cytogenetic localization to compare amniote genome organization with that of the amphibian xenopus tropicalis.
mammalian sex chromosomes arose from an ordinary pair of autosomes after the proto-y acquired a male-determining gene and degenerated due to suppression of x-y recombination.
