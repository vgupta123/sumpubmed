disease variants in the feature space consisting of residue conservation,
neighboring residue conservation, number of neighbors, and protein solvent
such similarity poses great difficulty in the classification of pgx
neutral variants and much less conserved than disease variants.
much less effective than between disease and neutral variants.
we found that pgx variants are much more similar to neutral variants than to
uniprot, to test the predictive power of sequence conservation and structural
in terms of sequence conservation, pgx variants are more conserved than
the pgx variants, as compared to disease-associated variants, have
characterization of pgx variants with annotated neutral and disease variants from
<dig> pgx variants of high quality from pharmgkb were selected and two data sets
forest was used to strike a more balanced classification for pgx variants.
