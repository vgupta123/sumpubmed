therefore, we quantified bladder inflammatory responses and alterations in urinary cytokine protein induced by intravesical bcg and compared the results to non-specific pro-inflammatory stimuli .
in addition, chromatin immune precipitation combined with real-time polymerase chain reaction assay  was used to test whether intravesical bcg would alter bladder cytokine gene expression.
in addition, bcg induces a unique type of persisting bladder inflammation different from tnf-α, lps, and, most likely, other classical pro-inflammatory stimuli.
our morphological analysis suggests that these polymorphonuclear neutrophils are of prime importance for the bladder responses to bcg.
we went further to determine whether bcg treatment alters cytokine gene expression in the urinary bladder.
it is not clear whether bcg induces the release of a unique set of cytokines apart from its pro-inflammatory effects.
to the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first to report that bcg induces an increase in the il- <dig> family genes.
acute bcg instillation induced edema which was progressively replaced by an inflammatory infiltrate, composed primarily of neutrophils, in response to weekly administrations.
chip/q-pcr indicates that acute bcg instillation induced an up-regulation of il-17a, il-17b, and il-17ra, whereas chronic bcg induced il-17b, il-17ra, and il-17rb.
intravesical bacillus calmette-guerin  is an effective treatment for bladder superficial carcinoma and it is being tested in interstitial cystitis patients, but its precise mechanism of action remains poorly understood.
c57bl/ <dig> female mice received four weekly instillations of bcg, lps, or tnf-α.
