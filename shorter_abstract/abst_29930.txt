using the cut-off value ± <dig>  calculated by receiver operating curve analysis, we found that Δbct correctly differentiated pathogenic nav <dig>  mutations from variants not causing biophysical abnormalities  and homologous snps  with 76% sensitivity and 83% specificity.
for each amino acid substitution, we calculated the topological parameters betweenness centrality , degree , clustering coefficient , closeness , and eccentricity , and calculated their variation .
gain-of-function mutations in scn9a gene that encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel nav <dig>  have been associated with a wide spectrum of painful syndromes in humans including inherited erythromelalgia, paroxysmal extreme pain disorder and small fibre neuropathy.
there is a need for better understanding of how gain-of-function mutations alter the atomic structure of nav <dig> .
these mutations change the biophysical properties of nav <dig>  channels leading to hyperexcitability of dorsal root ganglion nociceptors and pain symptoms.
we used homology modeling to build an atomic model of nav <dig>  and a network-based theoretical approach, which can predict interatomic interactions and connectivity arrangements, to investigate how pain-related nav <dig>  mutations may alter specific interatomic bonds and cause connectivity rearrangement, compared to benign variants and polymorphisms.
