production levels of 10-20 mg/l scfv-fc antibody were achieved in adherent hek293t cells.
enhanced throughput of antibody generation has been addressed by optimizing in vitro selection using phage display which moved the major bottleneck to the production and purification of recombinant antibodies in an end-user friendly format.
finally, an entirely new mammalian expression vector was constructed for single step in frame cloning of scfv genes from antibody phage display libraries.
employment of hek293-6e suspension cells expressing a truncated variant of the epstein barr virus  nuclear antigen   <dig> in combination with production under serum free conditions increased the volumetric yield up to 10-fold to more than 140 mg/l scfv-fc antibody.
transient expression of more than  <dig> different scfv-fc antibodies resulted in volumetric yields of up to 600 mg/l and 400 mg/l in average.
in this study transient expression of scfv-fc antibodies in human embryonic kidney   <dig> cells was optimized.
transient production of recombinant scfv-fc antibodies in hek293-6e in combination with optimized vectors and fed batch shake flasks cultivation is efficient and robust, and integrates well into a high-throughput recombinant antibody generation pipeline.
