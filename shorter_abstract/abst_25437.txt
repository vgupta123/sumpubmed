we show that mca recovers previously identified subpopulations, provides additional insight into the underlying correlation structure, reveals potentially spurious compartmentalizations, and provides insight into novel subpopulations.
with mca it is possible to investigate the robustness of covariate correlations with respect subpopulations, graphically identify outliers, and identify factors contributing to differential regulation between pairs of covariates.
however, identification of distinct subpopulations may be difficult if biological measurements yield distributions that are not easily separable.
biological data often originate from samples containing mixtures of subpopulations, corresponding e.g.
