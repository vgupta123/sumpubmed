for all four families, both computational techniques show considerable correlation  with the experimentally measured stabilities.
the present work combines two orthogonal computational techniques, molecular dynamics and a knowledge-based potential, for the prediction of structural stability of short peptides  in solution.
the structural stability of peptides in solution strongly affects their binding affinities and specificities.
thus, in peptide biotechnology, an increase in the structural stability is often desirable.
our results suggest a prediction scheme that can be used to estimate the relative structural stability within a peptide family.
we tested the new approach on four families of short Î²-hairpin peptides: trpzip, mbh, bhpw and epo, whose structural stabilities have been experimentally measured in previous studies.
