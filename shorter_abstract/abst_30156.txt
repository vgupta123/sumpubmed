the proposed lasso-based constrained least squares decomposition provides a stable and relevant relation between samples and knowledge-based components, and is thus a viable alternative to data-driven methods.
tumors have been hypothesized to be the result of a mixture of oncogenic events, some of which will be reflected in the gene expression of the tumor.
based on this hypothesis a variety of data-driven methods have been employed to decompose tumor expression profiles into component profiles, hypothetically linked to these events.
none of the data-driven methods allow the incorporation of that type of knowledge directly into the decomposition.
we present a linear model which uses knowledge driven, pre-defined components to perform the decomposition.
moreover, we show the decomposition of expression profiles from human breast cancer samples into single gene perturbation profiles and gene sets that are linked to the hallmarks of cancer.
for these breast cancer samples we were able to discern several links between clinical parameters, and the decomposition weights, providing new insights into the biology of these tumors.
lastly, we show that the order in which the lasso regularization shrinks the weights, unveils consensus patterns within clinical subgroups of the breast cancer samples.
interpretation of the resulting data-driven components is often done by post-hoc comparison to, for instance, functional groupings of genes into gene sets.
from a variety of options, a lasso-based solution to the model performs best in linking single gene perturbation data to mouse data.
