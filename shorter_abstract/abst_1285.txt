the present study assessed whether motor practice at a submaximal speed, which is typical in sports and music performance, results in an increase in a maximum speed of finger movements of trained and untrained skills.
the present study confirmed facilitation of fast finger movements following a piano practice at a submaximal speed.
piano practice of sequential finger movements at a submaximal speed over days progressively increased the maximum speed of trained movements.
transfer of learning facilitates the efficient mastery of various skills without practicing all possible sensory-motor repertoires.
this increased maximum speed of finger movements was maintained two months after the practice.
in addition, the findings indicated the intra-manual transfer effects of piano practice on the maximum speed of skilled finger movements.
