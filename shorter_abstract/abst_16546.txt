we develop a model of the psp response system, and illustrate how such models can be constructed and analyzed in light of available sparse and qualitative information in order to generate novel biological hypotheses about their dynamical behaviour.
our inferential approach can be applied to stress response and signalling systems more generally: in the abc framework we can condition mathematical models on qualitative data in order to delimit e.g.
within this abc approach we analyze stochastic and deterministic dynamics.
we have developed the first mechanistic model of the psp response in e. coli.
here we focus on studying the phage shock protein  stress response in escherichia coli induced by a phage infection or other damage to the bacterial membrane.
this model allows us to predict the possible qualitative stochastic and deterministic dynamic behaviours of key molecular players in the stress response.
bacteria have evolved a rich set of mechanisms for sensing and adapting to adverse conditions in their environment.
we analyze this model using tools from petri-net theory and study its dynamical range that is consistent with currently available knowledge by conditioning model parameters on the available data in an approximate bayesian computation  framework.
