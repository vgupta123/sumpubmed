to reach their fertilizing ability the male gametes must complete a process of functional maturation, the capacitation, within the female genital tract.
only once the capacitation is completed the spermatozoa can respond to the oocyte interaction with the exocytosis of acrosome content, acrosome reaction .
the effect of hubs elimination caused the collapse of networks structure, while the elimination of random selected nodes did not affected it.
mammalian spermatozoa, immediately after the ejaculation are unable to fertilize the oocyte.
this strengthens the evidence that the adoption of biological networks modellization of capacitation and ar could increase the understanding of spermatozoa physiology, potentially opening new perspective in drug discovery, diagnosis and therapy of male infertility.
this failure could be due not to the insufficiency of available data, but to the inability to manage them in a descriptive model.
thus, to overlap this problem, the capacitation and the ar were represented using the biological networks formalism.
