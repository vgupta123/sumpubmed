the expression of different neuronal and astroglial biomarkers was used to determine the cytochemical characteristics of hippocampal cells in long-term cultures of varying ages.
long-term primary neuronal cultures are a useful tool for the investigation of biochemical processes associated with neuronal senescence.
in conclusion, this study suggests that long-term primary cns culture is a viable model for the study of basic mechanisms and effective methods to decelerate the process of neuronal senescence.
it was observed that the expression of the intermediate filament nestin was absent from cultures older than  <dig> days in vitro , and the expression of neuronal or astrocytic markers appeared to replace nestin.
however, detailed studies of neuronal development in vitro are needed to demonstrate the validity of long-term cell culture-based models for investigation of the biochemical mechanisms of in vitro neuronal development and senescence.
in the current study, neuron-enriched hippocampal cell cultures were used to analyze the differentiation and degeneration of hippocampal neurons over a two month time period.
improvements in available technology make it possible to observe maturation of neural cells isolated from different regions of the rodent brain over a prolonged period in vitro.
it was found that there was an increase in endogenous production of aÎ²1- <dig> and an increase in the accumulation of congo red-binding amyloidal aggregates associated with the aging of neurons in primary culture.
