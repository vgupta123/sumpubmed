to evaluate the relationship between venom gene expression and prey utilization, we examined these features among individuals of different ages of the venomous, worm-eating marine snail conus ebraeus.
we determined expression levels of six genes that encode venom components, used a dna-based approach to evaluate the identity of prey items, and compared patterns of venom gene expression and dietary specialization.
venom gene expression patterns also change with growth.
venom gene expression is not significantly different among individuals consuming different types of prey, but instead is coupled and slightly delayed with shifts in prey diversity.
these results imply that changes in gene expression contribute to intraspecific variation of venom composition and that gene expression patterns respond to changes in the diversity of food resources during different growth stages.
all six venom genes are up-regulated in small individuals, down-regulated in medium-sized individuals, and then either up-regulated or continued to be down-regulated in members of the largest size class.
venomous organisms serve as wonderful systems to study the evolution and expression of genes that are directly associated with prey capture.
