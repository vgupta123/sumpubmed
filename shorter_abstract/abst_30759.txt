we detected expression for a total of  <dig>  genes, with  <dig> genes showing differential expression between the two embryo populations with false discovery rate  <  <dig> .
it is rare to have more than 40% of fertilized in vitro cattle oocytes reach blastocyst stage by day  <dig> of culture, and pregnancy rates are reported as less than 45% for in vitro produced embryos.
in addition,  <dig>  genes showed evidence of alternative splicing, with  <dig> genes displaying differential alternative splicing between the two pools .
a valuable tool for both research and industry, in vitro fertilization  has applications range from gamete selection and preservation of traits to cloning.
to investigate potential influences in-vitro fertilization  has on embryonic development, this study compares in vivo- and in vitro-derived bovine blastocysts at a similar stage and quality grade  to determine the degree of transcriptomic variation beyond morphology using rna-seq.
thus, our results support that ivf may influence at the transcriptomic level and that morphology is limited in full characterization of bovine preimplantation embryos.
using go enrichment analysis, multiple biological pathways were found to be significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes , including cholesterol and sterol synthesis, system development, and cell differentiation.
