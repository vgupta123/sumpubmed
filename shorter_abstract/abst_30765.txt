in this work we studied the dna repair system of mycoplasma gallisepticum on genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic levels.
we studied transcriptional response of dna repair genes of m. gallisepticum at stress conditions including heat, osmotic, peroxide stresses, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin treatment, stationary phase and heat stress in stationary phase.
dna repair is essential for the maintenance of genome stability in all living beings.
genome size as well as the repertoire and abundance of dna repair components may vary among prokaryotic species.
we detected  <dig> out of  <dig> members of the dna repair system on a protein level.
based on comparative genomic study, we determined that the dna repair system m. gallisepticum includes a sufficient set of proteins to provide a cell with functional nucleotide and base excision repair and mismatch repair.
we found that upon transition to stationary phase of culture growth transcription of dna repair genes decreases dramatically.
we identified sos-response in m. gallisepticum on ciprofloxacin, which is a known sos-inducer, tetracycline and heat stress in the absence of established regulators.
heat stress was found to be the strongest sos-inducer.
heat stress does not induce sos-response in a stationary phase.
the bacteria of the mollicutes class feature a small genome size, absence of a cell wall, and a parasitic lifestyle.
