our mechanical proof procedure and our testing methods provide a powerful arsenal of methods to ensure non-ambiguity.
ambiguity is a problem in biosequence analysis that arises in various analysis tasks solved via dynamic programming, and in particular, in the modeling of families of rna secondary structures with stochastic context free grammars.
we introduce, for the special case of stochastic context free grammars and rna structure modeling, an automated partial procedure for proving non-ambiguity.
it is used to demonstrate non-ambiguity for several relevant grammars.
as this problem inherits undecidability  from the namely problem for context free languages, there is no complete algorithmic solution to the problem of ambiguity checking.
