some of these proteins, called hub proteins or hubs, bind to many different protein partners.
these data support the conjecture that hub proteins often utilize intrinsic disorder to bind to multiple partners and provide detailed information about induced fit in structured regions.
here we present a detailed examination of two divergent examples: 1) p <dig>  which uses different disordered regions to bind to different partners and which also has several individual disordered regions that each bind to multiple partners, and 2) 14-3- <dig>  which is a structured protein that associates with many different intrinsically disordered partners.
for both examples, three-dimensional structures of multiple complexes reveal that the flexibility and plasticity of intrinsically disordered protein regions as well as induced-fit changes in the structured regions are both important for binding diversity.
