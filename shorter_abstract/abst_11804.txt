adomet-mediated methylation of dna is known to have regulatory effects on dna transcription and chromosome structure.
a cell cycle delay at the exit of g2/m phase was induced by 5-azacytidine.
surprisingly, three extra stretches of residues  were found on ccadomets, when compared to other members of this usually conserved protein family.
southern analysis, coupled with methylation-sensitive and insensitive enzyme digestion of c. cohnii genomic dna, demonstrated that the adomets gene is itself methylated.
l-ethionine was able to delay the cell cycle at the entry of s phase.
the present study demonstrates a major role of adomet-mediated dna methylation in the regulation of cell proliferation and that the ccadomets gene is itself methylated.
the increase in digestibility of methylation-sensitive enzymes on adomet synthetase gene observed following the addition of dna methylation inhibitors l-ethionine and 5-azacytidine suggests the presence of cytosine methylation sites within ccadomets gene.
during the cell cycle, both the transcript and protein levels of ccadomets peaked at the g <dig> phase.
phylogenetic analysis suggests that the ccadomets gene, is associated with the clade of higher plant orthrologues, and not to the clade of the animal orthrologues.
a full-length cdna encoding adomets was cloned from the dinoflagellate crypthecodinium cohnii.
modeled on the bacterial ademets, two of the extra loops are located close to the methionine binding site.
despite this, the ccadomets was able to rescue the corresponding mutant of budding yeast.
transcription of environmental-responsive genes was demonstrated to be mediated via dna methylation in dinoflagellates.
