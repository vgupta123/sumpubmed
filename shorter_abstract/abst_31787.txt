integrating vectors based on the int/attp loci of temperate phages are convenient and used widely, particularly for cloning genes in streptomyces spp.
we have constructed and tested a novel integrating vector based on g <dig>  encoding integrase, and attp site from the phage, sv <dig>  this plasmid, pbf <dig> integrates efficiently in s. coelicolor and s. lividans but surprisingly fails to generate stable integrants in s. venezuelae, the natural host for phage sv <dig>
