our results suggest that dnsiz <dig> is a functional homolog of the arabidopsis siz <dig> with sumo e <dig> ligase activity and may play an important role in the regulation of dendrobium stress responses, flowering and development.
we observed that dnsiz <dig> acts as a negative regulator of flowering transition which may be via a vernalization-induced pathway.
dnsiz <dig> is widely expressed in dendrobium organs and has a up-regulated trend by treatment with cold, high temperature and wounding.
moreover, ectopic expression of dnsiz <dig> in the arabidopsis siz1- <dig> mutant partially complements several phenotypes and results in enhanced levels of sumo conjugates in plants exposed to heat shock conditions.
