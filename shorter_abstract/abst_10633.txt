a genetic complementation assay with mutant proteins was combined with biochemical characterization demonstrating that the atpase activity of hera, the interaction between hera and nura, and the efficient 5′-3′ dna end resection activity of the hera-nura complex are essential for cell viability.
we revealed that each of the four genes in the same operon, mre <dig>  rad <dig>  hera, and nura, are essential for cell viability by a mutant propagation assay.
nura and two other putative hrr proteins: a pin -domain containing atpase and the holliday junction resolvase hjc, were co-purified with a chromosomally encoded n-his-hera in vivo.
