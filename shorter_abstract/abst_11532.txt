and these cells were checked as stem cell, hematopoietic and embryonic stem cell  markers by flow cytometry.
quantitative real-time pcr  revealed expression of oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog in bm- and at-mscs.
correct identification of these cells is necessary, but there is inadequate information on the msc profile of cell surface markers and mrna expression in dogs.

our results provide fundamental information to enable for more reproducible and reliable quality control in the identification of canine bm-mscs and at-mscs by protein and mrna expression analysis.
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells  and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells  are potential cellular sources of therapeutic stem cells.
in this study, we performed molecular characterization of canine bm-mscs and at-mscs using immunological and mrna expression analysis.
samples were confirmed to be multipotent based on their osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation.
however, nanog expression was  <dig> -fold higher in at-mscs than in bm-mscs.
