under the optimal condition at ph  <dig> , recombinant hp-nap with purity higher than 95% can be obtained from e. coli by collecting the unbound fraction using diethylaminoethyl  sephadex resin in batch mode.
here, we provide a simple process for high-yield production of hp-nap by applying one-step negative chromatography to purify recombinant hp-nap expressed in escherichia coli .

purification of recombinant hp-nap overexpressed in e. coli using deae sephadex negative mode batch chromatography is an efficient method for high-yield production of highly pure hp-nap in its native state.
in our e. coli expression system, recombinant hp-nap constitutes nearly 70% of the total protein.
the overall yield of hp-nap from a 50-ml e. coli culture is ~ <dig> mg. the purified hp-nap folds into a multimer with a secondary structure of α-helix and is able to trigger the production of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils.
due to its immunogenic and immunomodulatory properties, hp-nap has been used for developing vaccines against h. pylori infection and new drugs for cancer therapy.
overexpressed recombinant hp-nap is almost completely soluble upon cell lysis at ph  <dig> .
helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein  is involved in h. pylori-induced gastric inflammation.
the purified hp-nap is useful for various clinical applications including vaccine development, diagnosis, and new drug development.
