ultimately, arginine, leucine and dietary protein reduction seem to be unrelated with fatty liver development.
while dietary arginine increased total lipids, total cholesterol, hdl-cholesterol, ldl-cholesterol, vldl-cholesterol and triacylglycerols in npd, the inverse effect was observed in rpd.
likewise, leucine supplementation of rpd, regardless the presence of arginine, promoted no changes on total fatty acids in the liver.
in the present study, the effect of arginine and leucine supplementation, and dietary protein level, were investigated in commercial crossbred pigs to clarify their individual or combined impact on plasma metabolites, hepatic fatty acid composition and mrna levels of lipid sensitive factors.
overall, dietary treatments had a minor impact on hepatic fatty acid composition.
in contrast, arginine had no major impact, neither on hepatic fatty acids content nor on fatty acid composition.
significant interactions between arginine supplementation and protein level were observed across plasma lipids.
arginine supplementation was responsible for a modulated effect on plasma lipids, which is dependent on dietary protein level.
rpd, with or without leucine addition, upregulated the lipogenic gene cebpa but downregulated the fat oxidation gene lpin <dig>
arginine supplementation increased the gene expression of fabp <dig>  which contributes for triacylglycerols synthesis without affecting hepatic fatty acids content.
