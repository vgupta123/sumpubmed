omptins are a family of outer membrane proteases that have spread by horizontal gene transfer in gram-negative bacteria that infect vertebrates or plants.
pla and epo expressed in escherichia coli are both functional endopeptidases and cleave human serine protease inhibitors, but epo failed to activate plasminogen and to mediate invasion into a human endothelial-like cell line.
to simulate the molecular adaptation of omptins, we applied site-specific mutagenesis to make epo of the plant pathogenic erwinia pyrifoliae exhibit virulence-associated functions of its close homolog, the plasminogen activator pla of yersinia pestis.
our results stress the evolvability of bacterial β-barrel surface structures and the environment as a source of progenitor virulence molecules of human pathogens.
swapping of ten amino acid residues at two surface loops of pla and epo introduced plasminogen activation capacity in epo and inactivated the function in pla.
despite structural similarity, the molecular functions of omptins differ in a manner that reflects the life style of their host bacteria.
we describe molecular adaptation of a protease from an environmental setting towards a virulence factor detrimental for humans.
epo-expressing bacteria managed to invade human cells only after all extramembranous residues that differ between pla and epo and the first transmembrane β-strand had been changed.
