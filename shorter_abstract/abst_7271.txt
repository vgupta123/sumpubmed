sera from experimentally m. suis-infected pigs were screened for autoreactivity.
sera of animals previously immunised with the m. suis adhesion protein msg <dig> showed reactivity with actin prior to infection with m. suis indicating that molecular mimicry is involved in the specific autoreactive mechanism.
in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia , autoreactive antibodies directed against red blood cells are up-regulated, leading to erythrocyte death.
reactivity with porcine actin was significantly higher than with rabbit actin.
actin-reactive antibodies were found in the sera of 95% of all animals tested.
this is the first report of autoreactive anti-actin antibodies involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
