it is important to assay for off-target cleavage events at sites similar to the target sequence.
queries can be based on the target sequence or can be expanded using degenerate specificity to account for known zfn binding preferences.
we verified zfn-site using previously published zfn half-sites and located their target sites and their previously described off-target sites.
zfn specificity is not absolute; therefore, it is essential to select zfn target sites without similar genomic off-target sites.
while we have tailored this tool to zfns, zfn-site can also be used to find potential off-target sites for other nucleases, such as tale nucleases.
zfn-site is a web interface that searches multiple genomes for zfn off-target sites.
zfn off-target sites are outputted with links to genome browsers, facilitating off-target cleavage site screening.
zfn-site is an improvement over other methods because the fetchgwi search engine uses an indexed search of genome sequences for all zfn target sites and possible off-target sites matching the half-sites and stringency limits.
therefore, zfn-site does not miss potential off-target sites.
zinc finger nucleases  are man-made restriction enzymes useful for manipulating genomes by cleaving target dna sequences.
