post-translational histone modifications  and their specific distribution on genes play a crucial role in the control of gene expression, but the regulation of their dynamics upon gene activation and differentiation is still poorly understood.
here, we exploit the unique genome organization of ciliates to analyse ptm dynamics during gene activation in the differentiated cell and during nuclear differentiation.
we show that a specific relocation of these ptms correlates with gene activation.
this allows us to propose a mechanistic model about the relevance of ptms for gene activation, gene silencing and nuclear differentiation.
moreover, macronuclear-destined sequences in the differentiating macronucleus display a distribution of ptms which differs significantly from the ptm patterns of actively transcribed genes.
results described here will be relevant for eukaryotic cells in general.
therefore, ciliated protozoa represent a simplistic model system to analyse the relevance of histone modifications and their localization for gene expression and differentiation.
we show for the first time that a relocation of specific histone modifications takes place during activation of genes.
we analysed the distribution of three ptms on six individual nanochromosomes, two of which are silenced in the vegetative cell and only activated during sexual reproduction.
