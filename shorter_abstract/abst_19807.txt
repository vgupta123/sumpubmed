in addition, these proteins have been identified to have diverse functions such as cross-talking with different kinases and playing a role in cellular signaling.
the c-terminal region of tsg contains the characteristic domain of small rab gtpases, which imparts gtpase activity.
tsg has a bipartite nuclear localization signal that targets the protein to the nucleus.
here, we describe a new rab protein that is specifically expressed in male germ cells, having gtpase activity.
immunohistochemistry of testicular sections indicates localized expression in germ cells, particularly elongating spermatids.
at the n-terminal region, it has a coiled-coil motif that confers self-interaction properties to the protein and allows it to appear as an oligomer in the testis.
the most notable functions of this process are performed by numerous testis-specific and/or germ cell-specific genes.
however, only a few rab proteins have been found to have a role in male germ cell development.
