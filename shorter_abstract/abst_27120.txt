a verb's argument structure defines the number and relationships of participants needed for a complete event.
the two experiments of the present study examined whether and how this processing is reflected in distinct spatio-temporal cortical response patterns to isolated verbs and/or verbs presented in minimal context.
this produced additional activation between  <dig> and  <dig> ms in or near the left inferior frontal gyrus, activity being larger and peaking earlier for one-argument verbs that required no further arguments to form a complete sentence.
the magnetoencephalogram was recorded while  <dig> native german-speaking adults saw  <dig> german verbs, presented one at a time for  <dig> ms each in experiment  <dig>  verb-evoked electromagnetic responses at  <dig> â€“  <dig> ms after stimulus onset, analyzed in source space, were higher in the left middle temporal gyrus for verbs that take only one argument, relative to two- and three-argument verbs.
one-argument  verbs require only a subject to make a complete sentence, while two- and three-argument verbs  normally take direct and indirect objects.
