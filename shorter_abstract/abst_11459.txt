inflammatory bowel disease  consists of two main disease-subtypes, crohn’s disease  and ulcerative colitis ; these subtypes share overlapping genetic and clinical features.
in order to account for the topological structure of molecular interaction networks, we developed an optimisation algorithm that integrates databases of known molecular interactions with gene expression data; such integration enables identification of differentially regulated network modules.
optimisation was performed to highlight differentially expressed network modules that may be common or specific to the disease subtype.
as genetic diseases are believed to be caused by genetic alterations affecting the function of signalling pathways, module-centric optimisation algorithms, whose aim is to identify sub-networks that are dys-regulated in disease, are emerging as promising approaches.
we show that the selected subnetworks include genes and pathways of known relevance for ibd; in particular, the solutions found highlight cross-talk among enriched pathways, mainly the jak/stat signalling pathway and the egf receptor signalling pathway.

we verified the performance of our algorithm by testing it on simulated networks; we then applied the same method to study experimental data derived from microarray analysis of cd and uc biopsies and human interactome databases.
