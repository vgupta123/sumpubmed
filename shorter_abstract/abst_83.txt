yet for many biochemical systems, parameter values and even the existence of interactions between some chemical species are unknown.
it is therefore important to be able to easily investigate the effects of adding or removing reactions and to easily perform a bifurcation analysis, which shows the qualitative dynamics of a model for a range of parameter values.
facile implements the law of mass action to automatically compile a biochemical network  into scripts for analytical analysis , for simulation , and for bifurcation analysis .
a goal of systems biology is the quantitative modelling of biochemical networks.
facile automatically identifies mass conservations and generates the reduced form of a model with the minimum number of independent variables.
facile is a simple, yet powerful, tool that greatly accelerates analysis of the dynamics of a biochemical network.
this form is essential for bifurcation analysis, and facile produces a c version of the reduced model for auto.
we present facile, a perl command-line tool for analysing the dynamics of a systems biology model.
