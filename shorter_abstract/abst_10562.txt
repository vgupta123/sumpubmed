six subtype-specific rt-qpcr assays were developed for human hav.
in food microbiology, this approach is complicated by the low contamination levels of food samples.
to date, real-time reverse-transcription pcr has been one of the most promising detection methods due to its sensitivity, specificity and ability to deliver quantitative data in food samples, but it does not provide hav subtyping information.
subtyping results concordant with sequencing analysis were obtained from 34/ <dig> clinical samples.
these rt-qpcr assays may be particularly useful for accurately tracing hav in low-level contaminated samples such as food matrices but also to allow co-infection identification in human samples.

hav genotypes and subtypes differ in their geographic distribution and the incidence of hav infection varies considerably among countries, and is particularly high in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene.
phylogenetic analyses are traditionally used in clinical microbiology for tracing the geographic origin of hav strains.
