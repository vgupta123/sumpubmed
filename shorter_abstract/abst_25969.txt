thus, a more precise treatment of the complete environment of the label and also its interactions with the environment will be needed to increase the accuracy of in silico spin labelling algorithms.
different algorithms exist that predict the approximate conformation of the spin label either by using pre-computed rotamer libraries of the labelled side chain  or by simply determining its accessible volume .
epr-based distance measurements between spin labels in proteins have become a valuable tool in structural biology.
the direct translation of the experimental distances into structural information is however often impaired by the intrinsic flexibility of the spin labelled side chains.
here, instead of comparing predicted and experimental distances, we test the ability of both approaches to predict the actual conformations of spin labels found in a new high-resolution crystal structure of spin labelled azurin .
surprisingly, comparisons with many experimental distances have shown that both approaches deliver the same distance prediction accuracy of about  <dig> Ã….
our results illustrate why simple and more sophisticated programs lead to the same prediciton error.
