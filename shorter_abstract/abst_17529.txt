to better understand the mechanisms of surfactant secretion, we carried out proteomic analyses of lamellar bodies isolated from rat lungs.
these proteins fell into diverse functional categories: surfactant-related, membrane trafficking, calcium binding, signal transduction, cell structure, ion channels, protein processing and miscellaneous.
this proteomic profiling of lamellar bodies provides a basis for further investigations of functional roles of the identified proteins in lamellar body biogenesis and surfactant secretion.
lamellar bodies are lysosome-related secretory granules and store lung surfactant in alveolar type ii cells.
with peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization â€“ time of flight mass spectrometry,  <dig> proteins were identified with high confidence.
selected proteins were verified by western blot and immunohistochemistry.
