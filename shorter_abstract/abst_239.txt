there were no significant differences with respect to the pharmacodynamic variables either: serum neopterin and beta- <dig> microglobulin levels, stimulation of 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase expression, and serum ifn antiviral activity.
a randomized, crossover, double-blind study with a 3-weeks washout period, was done.
efficacy trials can be carried out to confirm clinical similarity.
the pharmacokinetic comparison by eia yielded a high similitude between the formulations.
interferon  alpha conjugation to polyethylene glycol  results in a better pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy.
in spite of a high subject variability, the parameters' mean were very close : auc:  <dig> vs.  <dig> pg.h/ml; cmax:  <dig> vs.  <dig> pg/ml; tmax:  <dig> vs.  <dig> h; half-life :  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  h; terminal elimination rate :  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  h-1; mean residence time :  <dig> vs.  <dig> h for reference and study preparations, respectively.
both products caused similar leukocyte counts diminution and had similar safety profiles.
both formulations are fully comparable from the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles.
