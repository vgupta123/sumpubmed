comprehensive explore novel cnvs in the bovine genome would provide valuable information for functional analyses of genome structural variation and facilitating follow-up association studies between complex traits and genetic variants.
copy number variations  are widespread in the human or animal genome and are a significant source of genetic variation, which has been demonstrated to play an important role in phenotypic diversity.
our results provide a significant replenishment for the high resolution map of copy number variation in the bovine genome and valuable information for investigation of genomic structural variation underlying traits of interest in cattle.

to confirm these findings, quantitative pcr  was performed for  <dig> cnvrs and  <dig> of them were successfully validated.
a total of  <dig> cnv regions  across the genome were identified, which cover  <dig> mb of the cattle genome and correspond to  <dig> % of the genome sequence.
