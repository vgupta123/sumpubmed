this system has great potential for a variety of applications, including gene therapy and the study of gene function.
this system had improved dox-inducible gene expression in terms of low basal expression, high induced expression and high responsiveness to dox.
the adenovirus that expressed soluble trail under the control of this novel tet-on system showed tumor-derived cells inhibitory activity in sw <dig> cells only under induced conditions.
the major problem of an adenoviral vector carrying a tet-on system is suboptimal regulation of transgene expression.
we constructed a single adenoviral vector carrying in its e <dig> region a novel “all-in-one” tet-on system with an autoregulatory loop.
to our knowledge, this is the first reported adenovirus-based, all-in-one tet-on system with an autoregulatory loop inserted into a single region of adenoviral genome.
our novel, single adenoviral vector carrying in its e <dig> region an all-in-one tet-on system with an autoregulatory loop displayed tight regulation of transgene expression in vitro.
one of the most commonly used vectors for gene therapy is the adenoviral vector; its ability to tightly regulate transgene expression is critical for optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

this system was further tested by inducible expression of soluble tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand .
