it has often been observed that homologous sequences can vary widely in their nucleotide or amino-acid compositions, revealing that sequence evolution has changed importantly among lineages, and may therefore be most appropriately approached through non-homogeneous models.
we show that the general implementation introduced here can accommodate virtually any type of non-homogeneous models of sequence evolution, including heterotachous ones, while being computer efficient.
these programs allow the user to describe non-homogeneous models through a property file with a simple yet powerful syntax, without any programming required.
it is available as dedicated classes in the bio++ libraries and can hence be used in any c++ program.
we hereby present a general implementation of non-homogeneous models of substitutions.
