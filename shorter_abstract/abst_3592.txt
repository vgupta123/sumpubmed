both species richness and abundance were strongly correlated with the size of the phytotelms and the season, while species diversity assessed with the shannon-index was affected by neither of the two.
the relative abundances of feeding-types of nematodes differed considerably in the wet and dry season.
nematodes are a very diverse and extremely abundant group of animals, but their occurrence in the tropics is surprisingly little understood.
rotifers were by far the most abundant group in both the dry and the wet season , followed by nematodes, annelids and harpacticoid copepods.
individual plants hosted up to  <dig> nematode species.
we investigated the meiofauna of epiphytic tank bromeliads in the lowlands of panama with particular emphasis on nematodes.
this is the first study with a particular focus on the diversity of nematodes in tank bromeliads.
we encountered  <dig> morphospecies of nematodes in  <dig> bromeliad tanks, which were sampled in the wet and the dry season.
