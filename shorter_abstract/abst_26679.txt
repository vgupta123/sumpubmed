in this study, we used a novel approach that combined kinetic modelling of gene expression with a statistical meta-analysis to predict targets of  <dig> tfs using expression data of  <dig>  genes in arabidopsis exposed to different durations and types of abiotic stresses.
we found that partitioning the expression data by tissue and developmental stage improved correlation between tfs and their targets.
some of these putative targets were validated from the literature, for e2f's targets in particular, while others provide explicit genes as hypotheses for future studies.
using a kinetic model for the time delay between the expression of a tf gene and its potential targets, we shifted a tf's expression profile to make an interacting pair coherent.
our method provides a general framework for tf target prediction with consideration of the time lag between initiation of a tf and activation of its targets.
our tf target predictions may shed some light on common regulatory networks in abiotic stress responses.
despite various computational techniques that have been developed for identifying tf targets, it remains a challenge to make best use of available experimental data, especially from time-series transcriptome profiling data, for improving tf target identification.
the framework helps make significant inferences by reducing the effects of independent noises in different experiments and by identifying recurring regulatory relationships under various biological conditions.
transcription factors  regulate downstream genes in response to environmental stresses in plants.
