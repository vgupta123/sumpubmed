flux coupling analysis  has become a useful tool in the constraint-based analysis of genome-scale metabolic networks.
as a consequence, fca of genome-scale metabolic networks can now be performed in a routine manner.
we propose f2c <dig> as a fast tool for the computation of flux coupling in genome-scale metabolic networks.
