to better understand the underlying mechanism of ripening, we undertook a study to evaluate global changes in the transcriptome of the fruit during the ripening process.
a large number of the differentially expressed genes identified were linked to ripening dependent processes including ethylene biosynthesis, perception and signalling, cell wall degradation and production of aromatic volatiles.
many of these are associated with cell wall degradation and synthesis of aromatic volatiles.
several genes involved in the synthesis of aromatic volatiles and members of transcription factor families previously reported to be involved in ripening were also identified.
in the banana fruit transcriptomes, we found transcripts included in  <dig> pathways described in the kegg database for rice.
a large number of differentially regulated genes were identified during banana fruit ripening.
these genes can be good candidates for future studies to establish their role in banana fruit ripening.
the datasets developed in this study will help in developing strategies to manipulate banana fruit ripening and reduce post harvest losses.
during the fruit ripening process a number of physiological and biochemical changes take place and thousands of genes from various metabolic pathways are recruited to produce a ripe and edible fruit.
a large number of differentially expressed genes did not align with any of the databases and might be novel genes in banana.
