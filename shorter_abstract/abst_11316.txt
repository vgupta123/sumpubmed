these results showed that homocellular interaction between tumor cells supports intercellular adhesion, whereas heterocellular glioblastoma/astrocytes interactions through functional gjc conversely support tumor cell migration.
carbenoxolone, a potent blocker of gjc, inhibited cell migration in the two latter models.
three complementary in vitro assays were used:  seeding on collagen iv, to analyze homocellular interactions between tumor cells  co-cultures with astrocytes, to study glioblastoma/astrocytes relationships and  implantation into organotypic brain slice cultures, that mimic the three-dimensional parenchymal environment.
we explored whether this concept may have clinical relevance by analyzing the participation of gjc in human glioblastoma invasion.
our results underscore the potential clinical relevance of the concept put forward by other authors based on experiments with a rodent cell line, that glioblastoma cells use astrocytes as a substrate for their migration by subverting communication through connexin 43-dependent gap junctions.
gliomas are "intraparenchymally metastatic" tumors, invading the brain in a non-destructive way that suggests cooperation between glioma cells and their environment.
