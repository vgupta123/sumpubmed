the best predictive models were lasso, svml and mag, with an average error rate, respectively, of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in fleckvieh, and  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in brown swiss.
in general, the use of snp genotypes proved to be very effective for the identification of mutation carriers.
the use of snp genotypes is a very effective and efficient technique for the identification of mutation carriers in cattle populations.

for the three models, the false positive rate was, respectively,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in fleckvieh, and  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in brown swiss; the false negative rate was  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % <dig>  % in fleckvieh, and  <dig>  %,  <dig> % and  <dig>  % in brown swiss.
snp  genotype data are increasingly available in cattle populations and, among other things, can be used to predict carriers of specific mutations.
a population of  <dig> fleckvieh and  <dig> brown swiss animals genotyped with the 54k snp-chip was available for the analysis.
mag appeared to be more robust to sample size reduction: with  <dig> % of the data, the average error rate was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in fleckvieh and brown swiss, compared to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % with lasso, and  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % with svml.
