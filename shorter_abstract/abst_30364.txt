we also identified one snrna candidate and  <dig> loci with a high number of tags that are yet to be annotated,  <dig> of which have a particular 18mer motif and are located in introns of genes involved in development.
a subset of new snorna candidates and putative ncrna candidates was verified by northern blot.
in this study, we have introduced a new approach to identify new members of known classes of ncrnas based on the features of tcs corresponding to known ncrnas.
we combined publicly available datasets of tens of millions of short rna sequence tags from drosophila melanogaster, and mapped them to the drosophila genome.
approximately  <dig> million perfectly mapping sequence tags were then assembled into  <dig>  tag-contigs  based on tag overlap.
the increasing interest in small non-coding rnas  such as micrornas , small interfering rnas  and piwi-interacting rnas  and recent advances in sequencing technology have yielded large numbers of short  rna sequences from different organisms, some of which are derived from small nucleolar rnas  and transfer rnas .
a large number of the identified tcs are yet to be examined experimentally suggesting that many more novel ncrnas remain to be discovered.
the typical length and tag-depth of snorna-derived tcs was used to predict  <dig> previously unrecognized box h/aca and  <dig> box c/d snorna candidates.
