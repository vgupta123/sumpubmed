the proposed method explores a support constraint to reduce search space and avoid generating random artifacts.
as the number of phosphorylated peptides are far less than that of unphosphorylated ones, we divide the mining process into two stages: the first step generates candidates from the set of phosphorylated sequences using only support constraint and the second step tests the statistical significance of each candidate using the odds ratio derived from the whole data set.
experimental results on real data show that motif-all outperforms current algorithms in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
phosphorylation motifs represent common patterns around the phosphorylation site.
motif-all is a useful tool for discovering statistically significant phosphorylation motifs.
we describe an algorithm called motif-all that is able to efficiently identify all statistically significant motifs.
to date, people have gathered large amounts of phosphorylation data, making it possible to perform substrate-driven motif discovery using data mining techniques.
