however, the roles of lpr gene family in rice  in maintaining pi homeostasis have not been elucidated as yet.
pi deficiency  triggered significant increases in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and  <dig>  strong induction in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and  <dig> in osphr <dig> suggested their negative transcriptional regulation by osphr <dig>  further, the expression levels of oslpr <dig> and  <dig> were either attenuated in ossiz <dig> and ospho <dig> or augmented in rice overexpressing osspx <dig>
the results from this study provided insights into the evolutionary expansion and a likely functional divergence of oslpr family with potential roles of oslpr <dig> and  <dig> in the maintenance of pi homeostasis in rice.
in arabidopsis thaliana, low phosphate root <dig>  and its close paralog lpr <dig> encode multicopper oxidases .
deficiencies of different nutrients ie, p, nitrogen , potassium , magnesium  and iron  exerted differential and partially overlapping effects on the relative expression levels of the members of oslpr family.

phylogenetic analysis grouped oslpr1/3/4/ <dig> and oslpr <dig> into two distinct sub-clades with oslpr <dig> and  <dig> showing close proximity.
here, the identification and expression analysis for the homologs of lpr1/ <dig> in rice were carried out.
quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analysis revealed higher expression levels of oslpr3- <dig> and oslpr <dig> in root and shoot, respectively.
