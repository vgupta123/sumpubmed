upon structural superposition with mxim, we have observed a putative hydrophobic cavity in meta <dig>  mutagenesis of select hydrophobic residues in this cavity affects the secretion of the secreted acid phosphatase , indicating meta1's involvement in secretory processes in leishmania.
using homology modeling of leishmania meta <dig> based on solved nmr structure of hslj, we show that meta <dig> and hslj share a similar structural fold.
the striking structural similarity shared by meta <dig>  hslj and mxim suggests a possibility of shared functions.
using multiple criteria including sequence similarity, nucleotide composition, phylogenetic analysis and selection pressure on gene sequence, we present evidence that meta <dig> originated in trypanosomatids as a result of a lateral gene transfer of a bacterial heat-inducible protein, hslj.
furthermore, within the leishmania genome, meta <dig> sequence is under negative selection pressure against change/substitution.
we sought insights into the possible functions of meta <dig> by studying its evolutionary origins.
overall, this work uses an evolutionary biology approach, 3d-modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to arrive at new insights into functions of leishmania meta <dig>
the best hit for other proteins with similar fold is mxim, a protein involved in the type iii secretion system in shigella.
