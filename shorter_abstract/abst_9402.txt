we recorded event-related potentials  during a visual target-identification task that required go-nogo choices.
erp measures contribute to a comprehensive explanation of the temporal dynamics of component processes of perceptual decision-making.
peak latencies of the color-related sn provided a chronometric measure of the duration of attention-related neural processing.
color discriminability was manipulated in three conditions to determine the effects of color distinctiveness on component processes of decision-making.
target identification was accompanied by the emergence of prefrontal p2a and p3b.
we propose a simple model of cross-dimensional perceptual decision-making.
erps recorded over the frontocentral scalp  revealed that color-overlap distractors, more than form-overlap distractors, required additional late selection.
the need for additional response selection induced by color-overlap distractors was severely reduced when color discriminability decreased.
no changes of cross-dimensional selection priorities were measurable when color discriminability was altered.
selection negativity  revealed that target-compatible features captured attention more than target-incompatible features, suggesting that intra-dimensional attentional capture was goal-contingent.
