as a component of the progression from genomic to proteomic analysis, there is a need for accurate assessment of protein post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation.
we present here a novel method to sensitively measure peptide phosphorylation by gsk-3β that, due to the incorporation of substrate controls, is applicable to either purified enzyme or cell extracts.
synthetic peptide substrates designed with a gsk-3β phosphorylation site were assayed with both recombinant enzyme and gsk-3β immunoprecipitated from nih 3t <dig> fibroblasts.
a molecular weight shift equal to that of a single phosphate group  was detected by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry  in a gsk-3β target peptide .
with the shortcomings of traditional assays in mind, the aim of this study was to develop a high throughput, non-radioactive kinase assay for screening glycogen synthase kinase-3beta  activity.
not only was there a dose-dependent response in molecular weight shift to the amount of recombinant gsk-3β used in this assay, this shift was also inhibited by lithium chloride , in a dose-dependent manner.
future studies using this method have the potential to elucidate the activity of gsk-3β in vivo, and to screen enzyme activity in relation to a variety of gsk-3β related disorders.
