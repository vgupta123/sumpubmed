fitbar  is a web service designed to identify new protein binding sites on fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes.
the local markov model and the compound importance sampling algorithms have been implemented to compute the p-value of newly discovered binding sites.
the web service is available at http://archaea.u-psud.fr/fitbar.
the in silico prediction of new binding sites in completely sequenced genomes is a key aspect in the deeper understanding of gene regulatory networks.
this feature constitutes the main advantage of this web tool over other matrix search programs and does not impair its performance.
other significant features include the production of a detailed genomic context map for each detected binding site and the export of the search results in spreadsheet and portable document formats.
several algorithms have been described to discriminate against false-positives in the prediction of new binding targets; however none of them has been implemented so far to assist the detection of binding sites at the genomic scale.
the binding of regulatory proteins to their specific dna targets determines the accurate expression of the neighboring genes.
