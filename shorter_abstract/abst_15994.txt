the citrus genomes contain 100â€“ <dig> scampps genes, approximately  <dig> of which are represented in the citrus est database.
the scampps amino acid composition, protein structure, expression patterns, evolutionary profile and chromosomal distribution are consistent with designation as ribosomally synthesized defense-related peptides.
the processed cyclic product of one of these phloem scampps was characterized by lc-ms-ms analysis of phloem tissue, revealing properties consistent with a k+ ionophore.
a gene family of small cyclic amphipathic peptides  in citrus is described.
unexpectedly high sequence conservation was observed in the promoter region of two phloem-expressed scampps that encode very distinct predicted cyclic products.
the structures of the scampps genes are highly conserved, with the small coding domains interrupted by a single intron and relatively extended untranslated regions.
the scampps genes are displayed in clusters on the citrus chromosomes, with apparent association with receptor leucine-rich repeat protein arrays.
comparison of the ests of related scampps revealed an unexpected evolutionary profile, consistent with targeted mutagenesis of the predicted cyclic peptide domain.
