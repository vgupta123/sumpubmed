the method was also applied to a microarray dataset on melanoma cancer patients with or without metastasis, where the main cluster was dominated by genes related to keratinocyte differentiation.
our method found clusters overlapping with known pathogenic processes, but also pointed to new connections extending beyond the classical pathways.
markov chain monte carlo sampling is used to search for the most reliable grouping.
specifically, our method makes use of bayesian statistics to identify groups of co-regulated genes based on the microarray data, where external information about molecular interactions and connections are used as priors in the group assignments.
applied to a microarray heart failure dataset the method found one large cluster with several genes important for the structure of the extracellular matrix and a smaller group with many genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.
these findings are difficult to interpret, yet crucial in order to improve the understanding of the molecular processes underlying the disease progression.
simulation results showed that the method improved the ability of identifying correct groups compared to traditional clustering, especially for small sample sizes.
we present a novel method for identifying groups of connected molecules from a set of differentially expressed genes.
these groups represent functional modules sharing common cellular function and involve signaling and regulatory events.
