recently, reverse chemical ecology approach using odorant binding proteins  as target for elucidating behaviourally active compounds is gaining eminence.
we screened  <dig> semiochemicals for their binding potential to a gobp of b. dorsalis using molecular docking  and molecular dynamics.
this methodology may be developed as a viable approach for prospecting active semiochemicals for pest control, which otherwise is a laborious process.
it is a common term used in the field of chemical ecology to encompass pheromones, allomones, kairomones, attractants and repellents.
in this scenario, we describe a “computational reverse chemical ecology” approach for rapid screening of potential semiochemicals.
the present study provides a unique methodology for rapid screening and predicting behaviorally active semiochemicals.
