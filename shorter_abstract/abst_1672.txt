inactivation of the atwhy <dig> gene did not affect plant development and had no detectable effect on mitochondrial morphology, activity of respiratory chain complexes, transcription or the amount of mtdna present.
overexpression of atwhy <dig> in plants perturbs mitochondrial function by causing a diminution in transcript levels and mtdna content which translates into a low activity level of respiratory chain complexes containing mtdna-encoded subunits.
atwhy <dig> is associated with mtdna and its overexpression results in the production of dysfunctional mitochondria.
we propose that they could play a role in the regulation of the gene expression machinery of organelles.
to understand the role of mitochondrial whirlies in higher plants, we produced a. thaliana lines with altered expression of the atwhy <dig> gene.
overexpression of atwhy <dig> also led to early accumulation of senescence marker transcripts in mature leaves.
organellar dna immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that atwhy <dig> binds to mitochondrial dna.
in arabidopsis thaliana, whirlies have recently been shown to be primarily localized in organelles.
stwhy <dig>  a member of the plant-specific whirly single-stranded dna-binding protein family, was first characterized as a transcription factor involved in the activation of the nuclear pr-10a gene following defense-related stress in potato.
