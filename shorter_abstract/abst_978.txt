r-svm was applied to two sets of seldi-tof-ms proteomics data, one from a human breast cancer study and the other from a study on rat liver cirrhosis.
the proposed r-svm method is suitable for analyzing noisy high-throughput proteomics and microarray data and it outperforms svm-rfe in the robustness to noise and in the ability to recover informative features.
the svm-based methods are also compared with a conventional univariate method and their respective strengths and weaknesses are discussed.
the multivariate svm-based method outperforms the univariate method in the classification performance, but univariate methods can reveal more of the differentially expressed features especially when there are correlations between the features.
like microarray-based investigations, high-throughput proteomics techniques require machine learning algorithms to identify biomarkers that are informative for biological classification problems.
