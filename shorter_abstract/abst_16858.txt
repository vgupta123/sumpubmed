we have analysed the genetic diversity of the 1d sequences, encoding the hypervariable surface protein vp <dig>  of turkish isolates of serotype a and o collected from  <dig> to  <dig> in order to obtain epidemiological and immunological information.
the sequence and structural analysis of the irn <dig> strains is indicative of positive selection suggesting an immunological advantage compared to irn <dig>  however, results of antigenic comparison reported elsewhere do not substantiate such a conclusion.
since, a member of the irn <dig> lineage was included as a component of the fmdv vaccine produced since  <dig>  the outbreaks caused by irn <dig> strains in  <dig> could be due to incomplete vaccine coverage.
the similarity plot of the serotype o isolates suggested a more homogeneous group than the serotype a isolates.
for serotype a, we confirmed the occurrence of the two subtypes irn <dig> and irn <dig>  these subtypes are most divergent within the region encoding the immuno-dominant gh-loop.
furthermore, the structural alignment of irn <dig> and irn <dig> revealed differences between the tertiary structures of these subtypes.
however, phylogenetic analysis revealed two major groups, each further divided in subgroups, of which some only consisted of turkish isolates.
positively selected sites and structural differences of the turkish isolates analysed, were not found.
the analysis of the deduced amino-acid sequences of these subtypes revealed evidence of positive selection in one site and one deletion, both within the gh-loop region.
foot-and-mouth disease  causes significant economic losses in turkish livestock.
