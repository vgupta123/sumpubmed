est2prot extends and significantly enriches the popular unigene mapping by utilizing multiple relations between known biological entities.
est libraries are used in various biological studies, from microarray experiments to proteomic and genetic screens.
est2prot uses unigene clusters, substring analysis, information about protein coding regions in existing dna sequences and protein database searches to detect protein products related to a query est sequence.
consequently, new discoveries are possibly overlooked.
the system is part of the biozon database and is accessible at .
gene ontology terms, swiss-prot keywords, and protein similarity data are used to map the ests to functional descriptors.
