likewise, the severity of ventricular dilatation is lower in minocycline treated hydrocephalic animals compared with the no minocycline group .
the ventricular dilatation were evaluated by mri at 1-week post drugs treated, while gfap and iba-1were detected by rt-pcr, immunohistochemistry and western blot.
the expression of gfap and iba- <dig> was significantly higher in hydrocephalic group compared with saline control group .
minocycline treatment of hydrocephalic animals reduced the expression of gfap and iba- <dig> significantly .
minocycline treatment is effective in reducing the gliosis and delaying the development of hydrocephalus with prospective to be the auxiliary therapeutic method of hydrocephalus.
