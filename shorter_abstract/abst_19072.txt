in this paper we present a novel method that seeks to dock protein domains using a contact map representation.
experimental investigations though present considerable difficulties and there is therefore a need for accurate and reliable computational methods.
contact docking appears feasible and able to complement other computational methods for the prediction of protein-protein interactions.
with respect to more standard docking algorithms it might be more suitable to handle protein conformational changes and to predict complexes starting from protein models.
we have tested the method on interacting domain pairs that are part of the same protein .
many biological processes involve the physical interaction between protein domains.
we use a scoring function that combines structural, physicochemical and evolutionary information, where each potential residue contact is assigned a value according to the scoring function and the hypothesis is that the real configuration of contacts is the one that maximizes the score.
the search is performed with a simulated annealing algorithm directly in contact space.
