typically, pcr amplification of dna from each panel cell line is followed by gel electrophoresis and scoring of each clone for the presence or absence of pcr product.
fluorescence of dyes bound to double-stranded pcr products has been utilized extensively in various real-time quantitative pcr applications, including post-amplification dissociation curve analysis, or differentiation of amplicon length or sequence composition.
computational analysis placed  <dig> markers on a chromosome map generated by the new method, while the gel-based approach produced only  <dig> mapped markers.
several markers could be scored only by the new method, and ambiguous scores were reduced.
we also obtained sequence data to augment dissociation curve results.
to improve sensitivity and efficiency of radiation hybrid panel analysis in comparison to gel-based methods, we adapted fluorescence-based real-time pcr and dissociation curve analysis for use as a novel scoring method.
as proof of principle for this dissociation curve method, we generated new maps of river buffalo  chromosome  <dig> by both dissociation curve analysis and conventional marker scoring.
thirty bovine markers  were suitable as cross-species markers for dissociation curve analysis in the buffalo radiation hybrid panel under a standard protocol, compared to  <dig> markers suitable for conventional typing.
dissociation curve analysis is reliable and efficient for radiation hybrid panel scoring, and is more sensitive and robust than conventional gel-based typing methods.
pcr-based dissociation curve analysis decreases both time and resources needed for construction of radiation hybrid panel marker maps and represents a significant improvement over gel-based methods in any species.
among  <dig> markers common to both maps, the marker order on the map was maintained perfectly.
