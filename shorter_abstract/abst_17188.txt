the study of the conservation of gene order or synteny constitutes a powerful methodology to assess the orthology of genomic regions and to predict functional relationships between genes.
in this work, i present synttax, a synteny web service designed to take full advantage of the large amount or archaeal and bacterial genomes by linking them through taxonomic relationships.
the web service is available at http://archaea.u-psud.fr/synttax.
this web tool was used to resolve successfully several conserved complex gene clusters described in the literature.
by analyzing the clustering evolution of alternative gene fusions, new proteins potentially interacting with this complex could be proposed.
synttax aims to produce robust syntenies by providing prompt access to the taxonomic relationships connecting all completely sequenced microbial genomes.
single or multiple organisms can be chosen on the basis of their lineage by selecting the corresponding rank nodes in the tree.
the synteny methodology is built upon our previously described absynte algorithm with several additional improvements.
