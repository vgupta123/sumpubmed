a principal components analysis separated seven male traits into three groups.
the study highlights how complex agonistic signalling systems can evolve through the simultaneous action of several selective forces, each of which favours multiple signals.
the dominant frequency of the knee-clicking sound honestly indicated body size, a main determinant of fighting ability.
in contrast, the dewlap size increased with estimated age rather than body size, suggesting that, by magnifying the silhouette of older bulls disproportionately, the dewlap acts as an indicator of age-related traits such as fighting experience.
the results show that the multiple agonistic signals in eland reflect three separate components of fighting ability:  body size,  age and  presumably androgen-related aggression, which is reflected in three backup signals.
specifically, loud knee-clicking is discovered to be an honest signal of body size, providing an exceptional example of the potential for non-vocal acoustic communication in mammals.
a longitudinal study provided independent support of these findings.
facemask darkness, frontal hairbrush size and body greyness aligned with a third underlying variable, presumed to be androgen-related aggression.
