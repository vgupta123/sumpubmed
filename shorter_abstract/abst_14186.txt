whereas experimentally, memory has only been observed during osteogenic differentiation, this model predicts that memory regions can exist for each of the four msc-derived cell lineages.
we study a minimal gene regulatory network permissive of multi-lineage msc differentiation into four cell fates.
control of msc differentiation is crucial for the success of much-lauded regenerative therapies based on mscs.
we have predicted new memory regions that will directly impact this control, and have quantified the size of the memory region for osteoblasts, as well as the co-regulatory effects on cell fates of substrate stiffness and culture duration.
we can predict the substrate stiffness ranges over which memory drives differentiation; these are directly testable in an experimental setting.
furthermore, we quantitatively predict how substrate stiffness and culture duration co-regulate the fate of a stem cell, and we find that the feedbacks from the differentiating msc onto its substrate are critical to preserve mechanical memory.
mechanical and biophysical properties of the cellular microenvironment regulate cell fate decisions.
we have yet to understand how memory affects specific cell fate decisions, such as the differentiation of mscs into neurons, adipocytes, myocytes, and osteoblasts.

taken together, these results can be used to develop novel strategies to better control the fates of mscs in vitro and following transplantation.
strikingly, we show that re-seeding mscs onto a sufficiently soft substrate increases the number of cell fates accessible.
