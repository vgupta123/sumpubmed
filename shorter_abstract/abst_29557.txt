the purpose of this study was to validate an analytical procedure for determination of the concentration of ahls in the ear rinses from dogs with p. aeruginosa-associated otitis externa.
for validation, samples from healthy dogs were spiked with none or different known amounts of the selected ahls.
in gram-negative bacteria, like pseudomonas aeruginosa, these signaling molecules are n-acylhomoserine lactones .
bacterial intercellular communication, called quorum sensing, takes place via the production and collective response to signal molecules.
therefore, it is important to recognize and define quorum sensing signal molecules in clinical samples.
to date, there are no reports on determination of ahls in the veterinary clinical samples.
validation proved that the procedure enables quantification of ahls in non-clinical and clinical samples.
this is the first report on determination of ahls in the clinical samples of veterinary importance.

our results indicate that liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry  is superior in detecting ahls compared to other chromatographic techniques.
samples were obtained with rinsing the ear canals with physiological saline solution.
p. aeruginosa is a common cause of inflammation of the ear canal  in dogs.
the treatment of p. aeruginosa-associated otitis is challenging due to a high intrinsic resistance of p. aeruginosa to several antibiotics.
attenuation of quorum sensing signals to inhibit bacterial virulence is a novel strategy for the treatment of resistant bacterial pathogens, including p. aeruginosa.
with the validated procedure, ahls were analyzed in the samples taken in weekly intervals from two dogs, receiving a standard treatment for p. aeruginosa-associated otitis externa.
the analytical procedure described in this paper is capable of supporting novel antimicrobial strategies, which target quorum sensing.
in addition, a time dependent reduction of ahl concentration was detected for the treated dogs.
