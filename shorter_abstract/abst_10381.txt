in this study, we performed microarray analysis to identify the genes and biological processes involved in piglet muscle maturity.
these results reveal the biological mechanisms that regulate muscle maturity in piglets.
the impact of the parental genome was analyzed with reciprocal crossed fetuses.
reciprocal crossing analysis resulted in the identification of  <dig> genes with an expression preferentially regulated by one parental genome.
maturity is also under the conflicting regulation of the parental genomes.
therefore, maturity is an important determinant of early survival.
microarray analysis identified  <dig>  differentially expressed probes for gestational age and genotype.
most of these genes  were regulated by the paternal genome.
skeletal muscle plays a key role in adaptation to extra-uterine life, e.g.
<dig>  probes, corresponding to  <dig>  unique annotated genes, involved more particularly in the maturation process were further studied.
among these paternally regulated genes, some known imprinted genes, such as magel <dig> or igf <dig>  were identified and could have a key role in the maturation process.
progeny from two breeds with extreme muscle maturity phenotypes were analyzed at two time points during gestation .
these genes could be excellent candidates for a key role in the maturity.
functional enrichment and graph inference studies underlined genes involved in muscular development around  <dig> days of gestation, and genes involved in metabolic functions, such as gluconeogenesis, around  <dig> days of gestation.
piglet maturation, which occurs at the end of gestation, leads to a state of full development after birth.
