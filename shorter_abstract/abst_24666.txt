we performed proteomic analysis on daphnia magna exposed to chemical cues of the predator triops cancriformis.
our results present promising candidate proteins involved in the expression of inducible defences in daphnia and enable further in depth analysis of this phenomenon.
the waterflea daphnia is well-known for showing a variety of these so called inducible defences.
d. magna develops an array of morphological changes in the presence of triops including changes of carapace morphology and cuticle hardening.
we discovered  <dig> protein spots with altered intensity when comparing triops exposed animals to a control group, and  <dig> spots were identified using nano-lc ms/ms.
however, molecular mechanisms underlying this plasticity are poorly understood so far.
phenotypic plasticity in defensive traits occurs in many species when facing heterogeneous predator regimes.
kairomone exposure increased the intensity of spots containing muscle proteins, cuticle proteins and chitin-modifying enzymes as well as enzymes of carbohydrate and energy metabolism.
identified proteins may be either directly involved in carapace stability or reflect changes in energy demand and allocation costs in animals exposed to predator kairomones.
