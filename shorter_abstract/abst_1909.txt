with up to  <dig> species, gibbons form the most diverse group of living hominoids, but the number of taxa, their phylogenetic relationships and their phylogeography is controversial.
to further the discussion of these issues we analyzed the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from  <dig> individuals representing all gibbon species, including most subspecies.
although relationships among gibbon taxa on various levels remain unresolved, the present study provides a more complete view of the evolutionary and biogeographic history of the hylobatid family, and a more solid genetic basis for the taxonomic classification of the surviving taxa.
nevertheless, the new data permitted the estimation of divergence ages for all taxa for the first time and showed that most lineages emerged during four short time periods.
gibbons or small apes inhabit tropical and subtropical rain forests in southeast asia and adjacent regions, and are, next to great apes, our closest living relatives.
based on phylogenetic tree reconstructions, several monophyletic clades were detected, corresponding to genera, species and subspecies.
the phylogenetic relationships among the four genera were also not well resolved.
we also show that mtdna constitutes a useful marker for the accurate identification of individual gibbons, a tool which is urgently required to locate hunting hotspots and select individuals for captive breeding programs.
in the first, between ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  mya, the four gibbon genera diverged from each other.
a significantly supported branching pattern was obtained for members of the genus nomascus but not for the genus hylobates.
