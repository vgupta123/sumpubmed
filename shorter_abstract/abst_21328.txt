our data suggests that low-coverage wgs is a viable strategy with a greater chance of discovering novel variants and associations than fixed content arrays for large sample association analyses.
low-coverage wgs is a strategy that appears to collect genetic information intermediate in scope between fixed content genotyping arrays and deep-coverage wgs.
we assessed variant calling through a comparison of the sequencing results to genotypes measured in  <dig> of the same subjects using a fixed content first generation exome array.
thunder was found to improve concordance in a coverage dependent fashion, while correctly calling nearly all of the common variants as well as a high percentage of the rare variants present in the sample.
linkage-disequilibrium  aware variant callers, such as the program thunder, may provide a calling rate and accuracy that makes a low-coverage sequencing strategy viable.
low-coverage whole genome sequencing  is a sampling strategy that overcomes some of the deficiencies seen in fixed content snp array studies.
we examined the performance of an ld-aware variant calling strategy in a population of  <dig> low-coverage whole genome sequences from a community sample of native americans.
