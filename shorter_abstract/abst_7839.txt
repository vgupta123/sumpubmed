three behavioural and ecological variables related to nutrition and predation risk  were significant predictors of residual variation in auk and penguin edp based on models predicting edp from egg mass.
therefore, auks and penguins provide a unique opportunity to assess the natural selective basis of variation in a key life-history trait at a low taxonomic-level.
our results suggest that both nutrition and predation have been important selective forces in the evolution of auk and penguin edp, and highlight the importance of considering these questions at lower taxonomic scales.
nutrition and predation have been considered two primary agents of selection important in the evolution of avian life history traits.
we suggest that further comparative studies on lower taxonomic-level groups will continue to constructively inform the debate on evolutionary determinants of avian edp, as well as other life history parameters.
the relative importance of these natural selective forces in the evolution of avian embryonic developmental period  remain poorly resolved, perhaps in part because research has tended to focus on a single, high taxonomic-level group of birds: order passeriformes.
we used phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the relative importance of behavioural and ecological factors related to nutrition and predation in the evolution of avian edp.
the marine bird families alcidae  and spheniscidae  exhibit marked variation in edp, as well as behavioural and ecological traits ultimately linked to edp.
