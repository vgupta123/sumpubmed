sequence analysis of the gene encoding for the antibody fragments and antigen recognition patterns determined by flow-cytometry analysis indicate that the isolated scfvs recognize novel epitopes in the prpc molecule.
a hallmark of prion disease is the transformation of normal cellular prion protein  into an infectious disease-associated isoform, .
anti-prion protein monoclonal antibodies are invaluable for structure-function studies of prp molecules.
in the present article, we show two new human phage antibodies, isolated on recombinant hamster prion protein .
the clones were found to recognize the prion protein in elisa studies.
these new anti prpc human antibodies are unique reagents for prion protein detection and may represent a biologic platform to develop new reagents to treat prpsc associated disease.
furthermore recent in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that anti-prp monoclonal antibodies can prevent the incorporation of prpc into propagating prions.
we adopted an antibody phage display strategy to isolate specific human antibodies directed towards rhaprp which has been used as a bait for panning the synthetic eth- <dig> antibody phage library.
in flow-cytometry studies, these human single chain fragment variable  phage-antibodies show a well defined pattern of reactivity on human lymphoblastoid and myeloid cells.
