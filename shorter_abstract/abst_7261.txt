dc are among the first antigen presenting cells encountering bacteria at mucosal surfaces, and play an important role in maintenance of regular homeostasis in the intestine.
our data show that the semimature differentiation state of dc can not be overcome by cd <dig> ligation.
additionally, semimature dc are nonresponsive to subsequent tlr stimulation in terms of maturation, tnf-α but not il- <dig> production.
we suggest that the inability of cd <dig> ligation in overcoming dc semimaturation might contribute to the tolerogenic phenotype of semimature dc and at least partially account for maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis.
however, stimulation of naïve murine dc with b. vulgatus or lps at low concentration drives dc to a semimature  state with low surface expression of activation-markers and a reduced capacity to activate t-cells.
we investigated whether the dc semimaturation can be overcome by cd <dig> ligation.
in contrast, phosphorylation of erk upon cd <dig> ligation was independent of the dc maturation state.
upon cd <dig> ligation smdc secreted il-12p <dig> but not the bioactive heterodimer il-12p <dig>  additionally, cd <dig> ligation of smdc resulted in an increased production of il- <dig> but not in an increased expression of cd <dig>  analysis of the phosphorylation pattern of map kinases showed that in smdc the p <dig> phosphorylation induced by cd <dig> ligation is inhibited.
