together, our study introduces a novel transcriptional regulator and its function in cooperation with chromatin associated factors and the basal transcription machinery.
like geminin, also tipt <dig> interacts with several polycomb factors, with the general transcription factor tbp , and with the related protein tbpl <dig> .
the re-replication inhibitor geminin binds to several transcription factors including homeodomain proteins, and to members of the polycomb and the swi/snf complexes.
