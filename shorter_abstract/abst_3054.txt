no statistically significant difference was detected between the gene expression profiles of the interlobular and intralobular fibroblasts by microarray analysis and rt-pcr.
while there was no significant difference in the gene expression profiles between the groups, there was an obvious difference in the expression pattern of several proteins tested.
the epithelial cells are surrounded by loosely connected intralobular fibroblasts, which are subsequently surrounded by the more compacted interlobular fibroblasts.
tissue sections were subjected to laser capture microscopy to isolate the interlobular from the intralobular fibroblasts.
the normal growth and function of mammary epithelial cells depend on interactions with the supportive stroma.
the human mammary gland contains two distinctive types of fibroblasts within the stroma.
this study is the first to report the gene expression profiles of the two distinct fibroblast populations within the human mammary gland.
the different proximity of these fibroblasts to the epithelial cells suggests distinctive functions for these two subtypes.
alterations in this communication can lead to the progression or expansion of malignant growth.
fresh normal breast tissue was collected from reduction mammoplasty patients and immediately placed into embedding medium and frozen on dry ice.
rna was prepared and subjected to microarray analysis using the affymetrix human genome u <dig> genechipÂ®.
findings from the microarray analysis were validated by rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry.
in this report, we compared the gene expression profiles between the two stromal subtypes.
