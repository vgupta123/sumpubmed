the fertilization success in sperm competition in externally fertilizing fish depends on number and quality of sperm.
the time delay between sequential ejaculations may further influence the outcome of sperm competition.
this sneaking behaviour causes sperm competition.
this result suggests that the time difference does not imply high costs to the second stickleback male to ejaculate.
in this pair-spawning fish, territorial males often try to steal fertilizations in nests of neighbouring males.
contrary to males, females may be interested in multiple paternity of their clutch of eggs.
slow fertilization  may be the result of sexual conflict in which females aimed at complete fertilization and/or multiple paternity.
such a time interval can load the raffle over fertilization if fertilization takes place very fast.
sneakers will only get a share of paternity when eggs are not fertilized immediately after sperm release.
there thus may be a sexual conflict over the speed of fertilization.
we show that complete fertilization takes more than  <dig> min which is atypically long for externally fertilizing fishes.
short fertilization times are generally assumed for externally fertilizing fish such as the three-spined stickleback .
