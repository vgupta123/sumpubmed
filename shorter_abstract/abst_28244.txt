to determine the amino acid residues responsible for the transport of vlps, we produced mutant vlps, in which residues of e protein were exchanged between the 6-lp and eg strains.
6-lp vlps were transported from the apical to basolateral side of endothelial cells, whereas eg vlps were hardly transported.
here, we analyzed the capacity of virus-like particles  of the highly virulent ny <dig> 6-lp strain  and the low virulence eg <dig> strain  to cross cultured human endothelial cells.
our results suggest that a transcellular pathway is associated with 6-lp vlps transport.
the localization of tight junction marker zo- <dig> and the integrity of tight junctions were not impaired during the transport of 6-lp vlps.
the transport of 6-lp vlps was inhibited by treatment with filipin, which prevents the formation of cholesterol-dependent membrane rafts, suggesting the involvement of raft-associated membrane transport.

endothelial cells could play an important role in wnv spread from the blood stream into the central nervous system and peripheral tissues.
we also showed that the combination of the residues  <dig> and  <dig> plays an important role in the transport of vlps across endothelial cells.
