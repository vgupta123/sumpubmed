fortunately, the recovery of most 'bigmessidae' genera with only minor degrees of paraphyly offers some hope for impending taxonomic amendments.
subclades are well defined and supported by subcorallite morphological features, providing a robust framework for further systematic work.
as expected, nested within 'bigmessidae' are four conventional families as listed above, and relationships among them generally corroborate previous molecular analyses.
one of the most challenging clades recovered by recent analyses is 'bigmessidae', an informal grouping that comprises four conventional coral families, faviidae, merulinidae, pectiniidae and trachyphylliidae, interspersed among one another with no apparent systematic pattern.
in this study, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of 'bigmessidae' based on five dna sequence markers gathered from  <dig> of the  <dig> currently recognized species collected from five reef regions in the central indo-pacific and the atlantic.
numerous examples of cryptic taxa determined in this study support the assertion that diversity estimates of scleractinian corals are erroneous.
indeed, wide geographic sampling here has revealed more instances of possible cryptic taxa confused by evolutionary convergence of gross coral morphology.
montastraea annularis, the only atlantic 'bigmessidae' is sister to cyphastrea, a grouping that can be reconciled by their septothecal walls, a microstructural feature of the skeleton determined by recent morphological work.
there is an urgent need for taxonomic revisions in this clade, but it is vital to first establish phylogenetic relationships within the group.
we present a robust molecular phylogeny of 'bigmessidae' based on the combined five-gene data, achieving a higher degree of resolution compared to previous analyses.
characters at the subcorallite scale appear to be appropriate synapomorphies for other subclades, which cannot be explained using macromorphology.
