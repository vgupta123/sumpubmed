this could mean that some msp7s can form different parasite protein complexes and/or recognise different host receptors during parasite invasion.
these results highlight the importance of this gene family in the plasmodium genus.
gene expansion and contraction rule msp <dig> family evolution; however, some members could have had concerted evolution.
even though msp <dig> has mainly evolved in line with a birth-and-death evolutionary model, gene conversion has taken place between some paralogous genes allowing them to maintain their functional redundancy.
the msp <dig> multigene family has been described in newly available plasmodium genomes; phylogenetic relationships were established in  <dig> species by using different molecular evolutionary approaches for assessing functional divergence amongst msp <dig> members.
on the other hand, the evolutionary rate of some msp <dig> paralogs has become altered, as well as undergoing relaxed or intensified  selection, suggesting functional divergence.

furthermore, episodic diversifying selection and changes in evolutionary rates suggested that some paralogous proteins have diverged functionally.
the merozoite surface protein  <dig>  is a plasmodium protein which is involved in parasite invasion; the gene encoding it belongs to a multigene family.
molecular evolutionary analysis showed that relaxed and/or intensified selection modulated plasmodium msp <dig> paralogous evolution.
