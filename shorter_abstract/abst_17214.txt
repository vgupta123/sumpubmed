interspecific variation in avian colour vision falls into two discrete classes: violet sensitive  and ultraviolet sensitive .
the phylogenetic distribution of sws <dig> cone opsin types in passeriformes reveals a much higher degree of complexity in avian colour vision evolution than what was previously indicated from the limited data available.
clades with variation in the colour vision system are nested among clades with a seemingly stable vs or uvs state, providing a rare opportunity to understand how an ecologically important trait under simple genetic control may co-evolve with, and be stabilised by, associated traits in a character complex.
changes in spectral sensitivity of the sws <dig> are ecologically important, as they affect the abilities of birds to accurately assess potential mates, find food and minimise visibility of social signals to predators.
they are characterised by the spectral sensitivity of the most shortwave sensitive of the four single cones, the sws <dig>  which is seemingly under direct control of as little as one amino acid substitution in the cone opsin protein.
sequencing a small gene fragment has allowed us to trace the trait changing from one stable state to another through the radiation of the passeriform birds.
still, available data have indicated that shifts between classes are rare, with only four to five independent acquisitions of uv sensitivity in avian evolution.
in the subsequent radiation, colour vision changed between uvs and vs at least eight times.
