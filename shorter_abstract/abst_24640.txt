however, the genetic basis of these differences is not well understood and the status of l.  peruviana as distinct species has been questioned by some.
the greater numbers of interspecific snp/indel differences between l.  peruviana and l.  braziliensis and the presence of different gene and chromosome copy number variations support the classification of both organisms as closely related but distinct species.
chromosomal read density and allele frequency profiling showed a heterogeneous pattern of aneuploidy with an overall disomic tendency in both l.  peruviana isolates, in contrast with a trisomic pattern in the l.  braziliensis m <dig> reference.
the extensive nucleotide polymorphisms and differences in gene and chromosome copy numbers in l.  peruviana suggests the possibility that these may contribute to some of the unique features of its biology, including a lower pathology and lack of mucosal development.
comparisons were focused on the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms , insertions and deletions , aneuploidy and gene copy number variations.
read depth analysis allowed us to detect more than  <dig> gene expansions and  <dig> expanded gene arrays in l.  peruviana, and the likely absence of expanded amastin gene arrays.
