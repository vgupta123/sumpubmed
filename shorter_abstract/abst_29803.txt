from the bioinformatical perspective, the reliance of most studies on a single snp caller disregards the possibility that different algorithms may produce disparate snp datasets.
snps and genotypes were called using three different algorithms.
of all conflicting genotype calls, clc was only correct in 17% of the cases.
this study presents the first effort to generate a population genomic dataset for wild-born orangutans with known population provenance.
our enhanced irrl approach greatly facilitates genotyping-by-sequencing and thus direct estimates of allele frequencies.
our direct comparison of three commonly used snp callers emphasizes the need to question the accuracy of snp and genotype calling, as we obtained considerably different snp datasets depending on caller algorithms, sequencing depths and filtering criteria.
furthermore, conflicting genotypes between two algorithms showed a systematic bias in that one caller almost exclusively assigned heterozygotes, while the other one almost exclusively assigned homozygotes.
in the laboratory, current protocols require improvements with regards to sequencing homologous fragments to reduce the number of missing genotypes.
genotype validations revealed that the unified genotyper of the genome analysis toolkit and samtools performed significantly better than a caller from clc genomics workbench .

we obtained substantially different snp datasets depending on the snp caller.
our modifications facilitate generation of single-sample libraries, enabling individual genotype assignments instead of pooled-sample analysis.
these differences affected scans for signatures of natural selection, but will also exert undue influences on demographic inferences.
