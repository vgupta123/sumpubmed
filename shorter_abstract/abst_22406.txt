moreover, finding a minimal set of molecular markers that have optimal ability to discriminate, for example, between given groups of varieties, is important as the genotyping process can be costly in terms of laboratory consumables, labor, and time.
the main advantage of the approach is to benefit from a flexible way to encode polymorphisms in a kernel and when combined with a feature selection algorithm resulting in a few specific markers, it leads to accurate and economical identification models based on ssr genotyping.
additionally, a greedy feature selection algorithm for selecting ssr marker kits is presented to build economical and efficient prediction models for discrimination.
an approach encoding ssr polymorphisms in a positive definite kernel is presented, which then allows the usage of any kernel supervised method.
the polymorphism between the samples is encoded through the nei-li genetic distance, which is shown to define a positive definite kernel between the genotyped samples.
when combined with kernel linear discriminant analysis or kernel principal component analysis followed by linear discriminant analysis, the approach leads to very satisfactory prediction models.
in crop production systems, genetic markers are increasingly used to distinguish individuals within a larger population based on their genetic make-up.
