pax <dig> is a transcription factor playing a crucial role in the development of the eye and in the differentiation of the pancreatic endocrine cells as well as of enteroendocrine cells.
our data indicate a conserved role of enhancers a and c in the pancreatic expression of pax6b and emphasize the importance of the homeoproteins pbx and prep cooperating with pdx <dig>  in activating pax6b expression in endocrine pancreatic cells.
studies on the mouse pax <dig> gene have shown that sequences upstream from the p <dig> promoter are required for expression in the lens and the pancreas; but there remain discrepancies regarding the precise location of the pancreatic regulatory elements.
we show that the pax6b p <dig> promoter targets expression to endocrine pancreatic cells and also to enteroendocrine cells, retinal neurons and the telencephalon of transgenic zebrafish.
in constrast, regions a and c of the zebrafish pax6a gene are not active in the pancreas, this difference being attributable to sequence divergences within two cis-elements binding the pancreatic homeoprotein pdx <dig>
to investigate the cause of this differential expression, we used a combination of in silico, in vivo and in vitro approaches.
deletion analyses indicate that strong pancreatic expression of the pax6b gene relies on the combined action of two conserved regulatory enhancers, called regions a and c. by means of gel shift assays, we detected binding of the homeoproteins pdx <dig>  pbx and prep to several cis-elements of these regions.
