bacteria are known to be associated with pwn and may have an important role in pwd.
here, we studied the biology of serratia sp.
oxyr and kata are directly involved in the high tolerance to h2o <dig> of serratia sp.
lcn <dig>  under oxidative stress, serratia sp.
this study provides new insights into the biology of pwn-associated bacteria serratia sp.
lcn <dig> through genome analyses, and further investigated, using reverse genetics, the role of two genes directly involved in the neutralization of h2o <dig>  namely the h2o <dig> transcriptional factor oxyr; and the h2o2-targeting enzyme, catalase kata.
lcn <dig> shares many features with endophytes , such as genes coding for plant polymer degrading enzymes, iron uptake/transport, siderophore and phytohormone synthesis, aromatic compound degradation and detoxification enzymes.
moreover, both mutants showed different phenotypes in terms of biofilm production and swimming/swarming behaviors.
lcn <dig> and its extreme resistance to oxidative stress conditions, encouraging further research on the potential role of this bacterium in interaction with pwn in planta environment.
lcn <dig> is phylogenetically most closely related to the phytosphere group of serratia, which includes s. proteamaculans, s. grimessi and s. liquefaciens.
pine wilt disease  is a worldwide threat to pine forests, and is caused by the pine wood nematode  bursaphelenchus xylophilus.

lcn <dig> is a pwn-associated bacterium, highly resistant to oxidative stress in vitro, and which beneficially contributes to the pwn survival under these conditions.
oxidative stress is generated as a part of the basal defense mechanism used by plants to combat pathogenic invasion.
