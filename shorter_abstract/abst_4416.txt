the high degree of homology within the protease’s active site and substrate conservation supports the identification of broad spectrum lead compounds.
modeller was used to generate a suitable three-dimensional model of the oc <dig> 3clpro and the prime module of schrӧdinger predicted the binding conformation and free energy of binding of 16r within the 3clpro active site.
further studies reproduced the binding pose of 16r within the active site of the generated model, where its free energy of binding was shown to equal that of the 3clpro of sars-cov, a receptor it is experimentally proven to inhibit.
a high quality homology model of the oc <dig> 3clpro was successfully generated in an active conformation.
this study will detail the generation of a homology model of the 3clpro of the human coronavirus oc <dig> and determine the potential of 16r to form a broad-spectrum lead compound.

molecular dynamics further confirmed ligand stability and hydrogen bonding networks.
the stability of the ligand was subsequently confirmed by molecular dynamics.
