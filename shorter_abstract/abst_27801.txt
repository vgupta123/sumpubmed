following  <dig> hours of infection with salmonella typhimurium, nf-κb activation was significantly elevated in vivo in placebo and enterococcus faecium-fed animals while bifidobacterium animalis ahc <dig> consumption significantly attenuated the nf-κb response.
the cellular mechanism underpinning bifidobacterium animalis ahc <dig> mediated attenuation of nf-κb activation may include recognition of the bacterium by dendritic cells and induction of cd25+foxp3+ t cells.
bifidobacterium animalis ahc <dig> exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via the attenuation of pro-inflammatory transcription factor activation in response to an infectious insult associated with modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production within the mucosa.
one such strain, bifidobacterium animalis ahc <dig>  has been previously shown to protect against salmonella typhimurium infection in mice and helps resolve acute idiopathic diarrhea in dogs.
the aim of this study was to investigate the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning the bifidobacterium animalis ahc <dig> protective effect.
bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are among the early and important colonizers of the gastrointestinal tract and are generally considered to be part of a normal, healthy microbiota.
no statistically significant change in the cytokine profile of mesenteric lymph node cells was noted.
in vitro, bifidobacterium animalis ahc <dig> was bound by dendritic cells and induced secretion of both il- <dig> and il-12p <dig>  in addition, co-culture of cd4+ t cells with bifidobacterium animalis ahc7-stimulated dendritic cells resulted in a significant increase in cd25+foxp3+ t cell numbers.
it is believed that specific strains within the microbiota can influence host immune-reactivity and may play a role in protection from infection and aberrant inflammatory activity.
