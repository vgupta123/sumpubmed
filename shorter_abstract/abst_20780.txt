we examined triplet motifs in a network of quantitative epistatic genetic relationships, and found a non-random distribution of particular motif classes.
as expected, nnn  motifs were strongly associated with previously reported genetic  interactions, while ppp  motifs were associated with protein complexes.
we present a model showing how nnp motifs can be used to recognize supportive relationships between protein complexes, while npp motifs often identify opposing or regulatory behaviour between a gene and an associated pathway.
the two other motif classes  showed very distinct functional associations, with physical interactions dominating for the former but alternative enrichments, typical of biochemical pathways, dominating for the latter.
individual motif classes were found to be associated with different functional properties, suggestive of an underlying biological significance.
these associations were apparent not only for motif classes, but for individual positions within the motifs.
