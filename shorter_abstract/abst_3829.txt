we found that 1) major functional modules are involved in various metabolic pathways and ribosomes, and 2) existing ppi sub-networks that are specific to succinate or benzoate metabolism are not in the center as predicted.
putidanet contains  <dig>  proteins, and  <dig>  possible interactions consisting of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   interaction pairs except for self interaction.
we introduce the putidanet which provides predicted interaction partners and functional analyses such as physicochemical properties, kegg pathway assignment, and gene ontology mapping of p. putida kt <dig> putidanet is freely available at http://sequenceome.kobic.kr/putidanet.
