we have developed a computational simulation of mesendoderm migration in the xenopus laevis explant model, which is a well studied biological model of tissue morphogenesis that recapitulates many features of this process during development in humans.
the simulation couples, via a java interface, an ordinary differential equation-based mass action kinetics model to compute intracellular wnt/Î²-catenin signaling with an agent-based model of mesendoderm migration across a fibronectin extracellular matrix substrate.
this integration enables the testing and identification of key systems-level hypotheses regarding how signaling proteins affect overall tissue-level behavior during morphogenesis in an experimentally verifiable system.
this is due, in part, to a lack of integrative tools that enable the coupling of biological phenomena across spatial and temporal scales.
tissue morphogenesis is a complex process whereby tissue structures self-assemble by the aggregate behaviors of independently acting cells responding to both intracellular and extracellular cues in their environment.
the emergent cell behaviors in the simulation suggest the following properties of the system: maintaining the integrity of cell-to-cell contact signals is necessary for preventing fractionation of cells as they move, contact with the fn substrate and the existence of a fn gradient provides an extracellular feedback loop that governs migration speed, the incorporation of polarity signals is required for cells to migrate in the same direction, and a delicate balance of integrin and cadherin interactions is needed to reproduce experimentally observed migratory behaviors.
