our aim was to exploit the modulation of sphingolipid mediators as new therapeutic target to overcome antifungal resistance in biofilm-related infections.
at 24h, tem studies showed important morphological alterations, such as invaginations of the cell membrane, modification in the vacuolar system and presence of multilamellar bodies, in some cases within vacuoles.
the direct antifungal activity, observed on both planktonic and sessile fungi, suggests that inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis could represent a new target to fight biofilm-related a. fumigatus resistance.
myriocin , a commercial sphingolipid synthesis inhibitor, was used.
sessile mics were assessed on 24-h preformed-biofilm by means of xtt-reduction assay.
