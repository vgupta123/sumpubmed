validation of our tool was conducted using clinical data sets including matched normal, prostate cancer samples in addition to the colorectal cancer and sclc data sets used in the original description of chromothripsis.
we introduce shatterproof, a software tool for detecting and quantifying chromothriptic events.
shatterproof takes structural variation calls  produced by any algorithm and using an operational definition of chromothripsis performs robust statistical tests to accurately predict the presence and location of chromothriptic events.
chromothripsis, a newly discovered type of complex genomic rearrangement, has been implicated in the evolution of several types of cancers.
