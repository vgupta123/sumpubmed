the combination of these technologies improves the feasibility and efficiency of mapping common disease susceptibility genes despite limited stocks of gdna samples.
we have investigated Φ <dig> polymerase multiple displacement amplification -generated dna product , in combination with highly multiplexed beadarray™ genotyping technology.
eighty-six mda product and the corresponding  <dig> gdna samples were genotyped at  <dig> snps and a concordance rate of  <dig> % was achieved.
as part of a large-scale beadarray genotyping experiment we made a direct comparison of genotyping data generated from mda product with that from genomic dna  templates.
the beadarray sample exclusion rate, blind to sample type, was  <dig> % for mda product compared to  <dig> % for gdna.
we conclude that the beadarray technology successfully produces high quality genotyping data from mda product.
