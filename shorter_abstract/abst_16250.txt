interrogation of cancer genomes holds the promise of understanding this process, thus revolutionizing cancer research and treatment.
jistic is an easy-to-install platform independent implementation of gistic that outperforms the original algorithm detecting more relevant candidate genes and regions.
as datasets measuring copy number aberrations in tumors accumulate, a major challenge has become to distinguish between those mutations that drive the cancer versus those passenger mutations that have no effect.
