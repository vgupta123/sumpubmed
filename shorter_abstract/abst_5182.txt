mycobacterium tuberculosis  causes death of 2â€“ <dig> million people every year.
the secretory proteins of m. tuberculosis have gained attention in recent years both as vaccine candidates and diagnostic tools; they target the immune system and trigger a putatively protective response; however, they may also be involved in the clinical symptoms of the disease.
this study showed the effect of secretory proteins of m. tuberculosis in the modulation of macrophage signaling pathways particularly erk1/ <dig> map kinase pathway.
stimulation of cells by esat- <dig> along with sodium orthovanadate  restored phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus, suggesting active dephosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> by some putative phosphatase in the nucleus.
the persistence of the pathogenic mycobacteria inside the macrophage occurs through modulation of host cell signaling which allows them, unlike the other non-pathogenic species, to survive inside the host.
esat- <dig> induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/ <dig>  in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus, which normally is the case for map kinases.
