a total of  <dig>  sequences were confirmed to be related to reproduction and key genes involved in sex differentiation and maturation were identified for the first time in turbot .
further,  <dig>  putative natural antisense transcripts  including micrornas were also identified.
genomic resources for plant and animal species that are under exploitation primarily for human consumption are increasingly important, among other things, for understanding physiological processes and for establishing adequate genetic selection programs.
the combined sequencing strategies employed here significantly increased the turbot genomic resources available, including  <dig>  novel sequences.
the objective of this study was to generate a comprehensive transcriptomic database in turbot, a highly priced farmed fish species in europe, with potential expansion to other areas of the world, for which there are unsolved production bottlenecks, to understand better reproductive- and immune-related functions.
expressed sequence tags were generated by sanger sequencing of cdna libraries from different immune-related tissues after several parasitic challenges.
similarly,  <dig>  sequences were related to the immune system and several novel key immune genes were identified .
