genomic imprinting is an epigenetic source of variation in quantitative traits that results from monoallelic gene expression, where commonly either only the paternally- or the maternally-derived allele is expressed.
our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of genomic imprinting effects that depend on sex and are not related to sex-chromosome effects.
our results clearly show that imprinting effects can be sex-dependent and also suggest that new candidate imprinted loci can be detected when taking account of sex-specific imprinting effects.
imprinting has been shown to affect a diversity of complex traits in a variety of species.
moreover, theoretical work on the evolution of sex-dependent genomic imprinting effects makes specific predictions about the phenotypic patterns of such effects, which, however, have not been assessed empirically to date.
one locus showed sex-dependent imprinting effects in both sexes for different traits.
however, predictions made about the evolution of sex-dependent imprinting effects and associated phenotypic patterns cannot be unequivocally supported at present and further research into the selection pressures applied to the strains of mice used in our study is required.
the absence of an imprinting effect in one sex was not necessarily indicative of the overall inactivity of the locus in that sex, as for several loci a significant additive or dominance effect was detected.
moreover, three loci exhibited significant additive effects in both sexes but their imprinting effect was restricted to one sex.
