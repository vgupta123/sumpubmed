measurement of microarray-based endpoints for maph appears to be of comparable accuracy to electrophoretic methods, and holds the prospect of fully exploiting the potential multiplicity of maph.
in this study, to improve the throughput associated with multiplex amplifiable probe hybridisation  we aimed to develop a modification based on the 3-dimensional, flow-through microarray platform from pamgene international.
current methods for measurement of copy number do not combine all the desirable qualities of convenience, throughput, economy, accuracy and resolution.
copy number analysis of hybridised probes is based on a dual-label approach by comparing the intensity of cy3-labelled maph probes amplified from test samples co-hybridised with similarly amplified cy5-labelled reference maph probes.
in this study we showed that microarray maph measurement of pmp <dig> gene dosage correlates well with pmp <dig> gene dosage determined by capillary maph and that copy number was accurately reported in analyses of dna from  <dig> individuals,  <dig> of which were known to have charcot-marie-tooth disease type 1a .
the technology has the potential to simplify copy number assays for genes with a large number of exons, or of expanded sets of probes from dispersed genomic locations.
