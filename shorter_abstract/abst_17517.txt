adenosine-5′-triphosphate  is one of multifunctional nucleotides and plays an important role in cell biology as a coenzyme interacting with proteins.
prediction performances evaluated by both 5-fold and leave-one-out jackknife cross-validation tests on two benchmark datasets consisting of  <dig> and  <dig> non-homologous atp binding proteins respectively demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed protocol.
our experimental results also reveal that the residue structural characteristics of real protein-atp binding sites are significant different from those normal ones, for example the binding residues do not show high solvent accessibility propensities, and the bindings prefer to occur at the conjoint points between different secondary structure segments.
furthermore, results also show that performance is affected by the imbalanced training datasets by testing multiple ratios between positive and negative samples in the experiments.
in this paper, we propose a novel framework for predicting the proteins’ functional residues, through which they can bind with atp molecules.
increasing the dataset scale is also demonstrated useful for improving the prediction performances.
