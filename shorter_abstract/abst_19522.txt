reduction in sm <dig> levels would tend to promote cell survival when cells are under stress, such as in a hypoxic tumour environment, and may also contribute to increases in actin dynamics that favour metastatic potential.
furthermore sm <dig> depleted cells also had reduced levels of reactive oxygen species when under serum starvation stress.
