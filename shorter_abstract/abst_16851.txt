rpoe was important for bacterial growth at low and high temperatures, in the minimal medium, and high salinity.
pgpd exhibited higher activities and played a more important role in the oxidative stress responses than the cytoplasmic glutathione peroxidase cgpd under tested conditions.
in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  the rpoe-dependent degq gene is required for optimal growth under high temperature.
but rpoe <dig> is not required for bacterial growth at low temperature and it even affected bacterial growth under salt stress, indicating that there is a tradeoff between the salt resistance and rpoe2-mediated oxidative stress responses.
the degp/htra orthologue, required for growth of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa at high temperature, is absent in shewanella, while the degq gene is rpoe-regulated and is required for bacterial growth at high temperature.
rpoe <dig> was essential for the optimal growth in oxidative stress conditions because the rpoe <dig> mutant was sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat.
the rpoe2-chrr operon and the identified regulon genes, including pgpd and hemh <dig>  are coincidently absent in several psychrophilic and/or deep-sea shewanella strains.
the rpoe <dig> and rpoe2-dependent pgpd gene encoding a periplasmic glutathione peroxidase are involved in oxidative stress responses.
