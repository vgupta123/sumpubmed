tissue fixation is crucial for preserving the morphology of biological structures and cytological details to prevent postmortem degradation and autolysis.
we found that piperazine-n,n’-bis  and 4--1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid , two zwitterionic buffers commonly used in tissue fixation, can cause severe lumen and cell morphological defects in drosophila pupal and adult retina; the inter-rhabdomeral lumen becomes dilated and the photoreceptor cells are significantly reduced in size.
improper fixation conditions could lead to artifacts and thus incorrect conclusions in immunofluorescence or histology experiments.
in contrast, tissues fixed in the phosphate buffered saline  buffer results in lumen and cell morphologies that are consistent with live imaging.
we suggest that pipes and hepes buffers should be utilized with caution for fixation when examining the interplay between cells and their extracellular environment, especially in drosophila pupal and adult retina research.
correspondingly, the localization pattern of eyes shut , a luminal protein, is severely altered.
