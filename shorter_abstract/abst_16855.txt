orca <dig> may play an especially important role in regulation of the downstream branches of the tia pathway, as it regulates four out of five genes characterized from this part of the pathway.
regulation of tia transcriptional repressors by orca <dig> may provide a mechanism whereby increases in tia metabolite levels in response to external stimuli are transient and limited in magnitude.
transcriptional profiling experiments revealed that overexpression of orca <dig> results in altered expression of key genes from the indole and terpenoid pathways, which produce precursors for the tia pathway, and from the tia pathway itself.
orca <dig> regulates expression of key genes from both feeder pathways, as well as the genes  encoding the enzymes that catalyze the first two steps in tia biosynthesis.
orca <dig> overexpression also causes significant increases in transcript levels of several tia regulators, including tia transcriptional repressors.
results presented here indicate that orca <dig> plays a critical role in regulation of tia metabolism.
in addition, metabolite-profiling experiments revealed that overexpression of orca <dig> significantly affects the levels of several tia metabolites.
