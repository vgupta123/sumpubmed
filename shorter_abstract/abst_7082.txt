the hominid specific sine-vntr-alus are the youngest of these elements constituting  <dig> % of the genome; they are therefore a practical and amenable group for analysis of both their global integration, polymorphic variation and their potential contribution to modulation of genome regulation.
the sequences of svas show potential for the formation of secondary structure including g-quadruplex dna.
consistent with insertion into active chromatin we have determined that svas are more prevalent in genic regions compared to gene deserts.
functionally we were able to demonstrate that this sva contains multiple regulatory elements that support reporter gene expression in vitro and further show these elements exhibit orientation dependency.
retrotransposons are a major component of the human genome constituting as much as 45%.
