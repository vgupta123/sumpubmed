we show that hin-mediated dna knotting and recombination  promote replicon loss by blocking dna replication;  block gene transcription; and  cause genetic rearrangements at a rate three to four orders of magnitude higher than the rate for an unknotted, unrecombined plasmid.
these results show that dna reactivity leading to recombined and knotted dna is potentially toxic and may help drive genetic evolution.
here we analyze the effects of recombined and knotted plasmids in e. coli using the hin site-specific recombination system.
