in many applications, such as a large-scale database homology search for transmembrane proteins, these models are not the most appropriate ones.
in a second step, we extend the approach to a model of transmembrane proteins, which can hardly be described as i.i.d.
a specific roc analysis for the case of transmembrane proteins supports our observation.
we present results for the score statistics of fixed and random queries against random sequences.
the results illustrate that the sensitivity and specificity strongly depend on the underlying scoring and sequence model.
search sensitivity and specificity benefit from position-dependent scoring schemes or use of hidden markov models.
some effort had been made to include effects of finite sequence lengths and to account for specific compositions of the sequences.
in the classical approach one asks the question how probable a certain score is observed by pure chance.
we have access to the low-probability region  of the distribution where scores are larger than expected by pure chance and therefore relevant for practical applications.
in this paper, we discuss an efficient and general method to compute the score distribution to any desired accuracy.
