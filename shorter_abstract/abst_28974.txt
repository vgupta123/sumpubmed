we must solve mce on instances deeply seeded in data mining and computational biology, where high-throughput data capture often creates graphs of extreme size and density.
the maximum clique enumeration  problem asks that we identify all maximum cliques in a finite, simple graph.
in particular, with real data there tends to be an unusually high degree of maximum clique overlap.
mce is closely related to two other well-known and widely-studied problems: the maximum clique optimization problem, which asks us to determine the size of a largest clique, and the maximal clique enumeration problem, which asks that we compile a listing of all maximal cliques.
several algorithmic improvements to mce are made which progressively decrease the run time on graphs in the testbed.
