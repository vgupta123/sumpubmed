individual blastocysts were lysed to obtain crude dna solutions, which were used for polymerase chain reaction  assays.
mouse fertilized eggs were microinjected with crispr/cas9-related rna/dna to examine whether non-homologous end joining-mediated knockout and homologous recombination-mediated knockin occurred in the endogenous receptor  activity modifying protein  <dig>  gene.
t <dig> endonuclease i was more effective than surveyor nuclease for detecting mutations in annealed fragments derived from  <dig> plasmids, which contained nearly identical sequences.
our results also established that crude dna from a single blastocyst was an appropriate template for whole genome amplification and subsequent assessment by pcr and the t <dig> endonuclease i-based assay.

microinjection of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat /crispr-associated protein  <dig> -related rna and dna into fertilized eggs is a novel approach for creating gene-modified mice.
however, it is not known whether indel mutations caused by the crispr/cas <dig> system can be reproducibly detected in embryos.
