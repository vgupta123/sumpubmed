we propose that rasgefm is a component of a ras regulated pathway, which integrate signals acting as positive regulator for adenylyl cyclase and negative regulator for guanylyl cyclase.
they act as molecular switches by cycling between active gtp and inactive gdp-bound states, through the action of two classes of regulatory proteins: a) guanine nucleotide exchange factor  and b) gtp-ase activating proteins .
in vitro experiments suggest that rasgefm acts downstream of the camp receptor but upstream of the g protein.
adenylyl cyclase activation in response to camp pulses is strongly reduced, by contrast guanylyl cyclase is stimulated to higher levels than in the wild type.
endogenous camp accumulates during early development to a much lower extent than in wild type cells.
inactivation of the gene results in cells that form small, flat aggregates and fail to develop further.
altered guanylyl cyclase, combined with defective regulation of actin polymerization, results in altered chemotaxis.
genome wide analysis of the lower eukaryote dictyostelium discoideum revealed a surprisingly large number of ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors .
the rasgefm gene is differentially expressed during growth and development.
ras proteins are guanine-nucleotide-binding enzymes that couple cell surface receptors to intracellular signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and differentiation, both in lower and higher eukaryotes.
rasgefs promote the activation of ras proteins by catalyzing the exchange of gdp for gtp, thus conferring to rasgefs the role of main activator of ras proteins.
the actin polymerization response to camp is also altered in the mutant.
