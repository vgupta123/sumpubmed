we were able to determine that long-term dc cultures produce an array of angiogenic factors, and that some of these cultures still retain the capability to induce t cell responses.
to accomplish this, we cultured murine myeloid dcs on surfaces coated with fibronectin, collagen i, gelatin, and matrigel using poly-d-lysine and polystyrene as non-biological surfaces.
we hypothesize that this plasticity may be caused not only by the action of specific cytokines or growth factors but also by the properties of the surfaces with which they interact, such as extracellular matrix  components.
herewith we studied the effect of different surfaces and soluble factors on the biology of dcs.
interestingly, microenvironment conditions such as those present in tumor settings might induce a dc phenotype that is poorly immunogenic and with the capability of promoting angiogenesis.
dendritic cells  are antigen presenting cells capable of inducing specific immune responses against microbial infections, transplant antigens, or tumors.
further, we cultured these cells in the presence of regular dc medium  or commercially available endothelial medium .
