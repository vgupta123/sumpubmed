these results, together with data on other vertebrates show that the tetrapod hox clusters are more variable than previously thought.
variation in limb types, as is the case in amphibians, can probably not only be attributed to variation in hox genes, but is likely to be the product of differences in gene regulation.
this conserved region is a known regulatory element and functions as a boundary element in neural tissue to prevent expression of hoxd genes.
we sequenced the posterior end of the hoxd cluster of a caecilian and performed comparative analyses of this region using hoxd clusters of other vertebrates.
the posterior genes of the hoxd cluster play a crucial role in the patterning of the tetrapod limb.
with a collection of vertebrate genome sequences available today, we used a comparative genomics approach to study the posterior hoxd cluster of amphibians.
we found that the caecilian hoxd cluster is almost three times larger than its mammalian counterpart.
the posterior part of the hoxd cluster of typhlonectes natans is among the largest known today.
the loss of hoxd- <dig> and the expansion of the intergenic region may exert an influence on the limb enhancer, by having to bypass a distance seven times that of regular hoxd clusters.
