the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized the field of microbial ecology via the sequencing of phylogenetic marker genes .
the increasing popularity of the illumina miseq platform for these applications requires the development of appropriate denoising methods.
reducing the error rate had a positive effect on the clustering of reads in operational taxonomic units, with an almost perfect correspondence between the number of clusters and the theoretical number of species present in the mock communities.
apart from significantly reducing the error rate of the sequencing reads, it has also a beneficial effect on their clustering into operational taxonomic units.
the newly proposed denoising algorithm iped includes a machine learning method which predicts potentially erroneous positions in sequencing reads based on a combination of quality metrics.
this is achieved by masking potentially erroneous positions during this clustering step.
