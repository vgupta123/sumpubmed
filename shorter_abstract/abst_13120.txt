three weekly intramuscular injections of  <dig> μg of eso complexed with pei2k-peg <dig> copolymers resulted in about  <dig> dystrophin-positive fibers and about 12% of normal levels of dystrophin expression at  <dig> weeks after the initial injection, which is significantly greater than for injections of eso alone, which are known to be almost completely ineffective.
h&e staining of all treated muscle groups revealed no overt signs of cytotoxicity.
exon skipping oligonucleotides  of 2'o-methyl  and morpholino chemistry have been shown to restore dystrophin expression in muscle fibers from the mdx mouse, and are currently being tested in phase i clinical trials for duchenne muscular dystrophy .
surprisingly, using the same injection and dosing regimen, we found no significant difference in dystrophin expression by western blot between the ng-pei2k-peg <dig>  cg-pei2k-peg5k, and non-functionalized pei2k-peg <dig> copolymers.
we examined whether peg-pei copolymers can facilitate eso-mediated dystrophin expression after intramuscular injections into tibialis anterior  muscles of mdx mice.
dose-response experiments using the cg-pei2k-peg5k copolymer with total eso ranging from 3– <dig> μg yielded a maximum of about 15% dystrophin expression.
further improvements in dystrophin expression up to 20% of normal levels were found at  <dig> weeks after  <dig> twice-weekly injections of the ng-pei2k-peg <dig> copolymer complexed with  <dig> μg of eso per injection.
we conclude that pegylated pei2k copolymers are efficient carriers for local delivery of 2'ome esos and warrant further development as potential therapeutics for treatment of dmd.
however, esos remain limited in their effectiveness because of an inadequate delivery profile.
in an effort to enhance biocompatibility and cellular uptake, the pei2k-peg <dig> and pei2k-peg5k copolymers were functionalized by covalent conjugation with nanogold  or adsorbtion of colloidal gold , respectively.
we utilized a set of peg-pei copolymers containing  <dig> kda pei and either  <dig> da or  <dig> kda peg, both of which bind 2'ome esos with high affinity and form stable nanoparticulates with a relatively low surface charge.
