since all high-throughput sequencing platforms incorporate errors in their output, short-read assemblers must be designed to account for this error while utilizing all available data.
qsra provides a step closer to the goal of de novo assembly of complex genomes, improving upon the original vcake algorithm by not only drastically reducing runtimes but also increasing the viability of the assembly algorithm through further error handling capabilities.
qsra is extremely competitive in its longest contig and n50/n <dig> contig lengths, producing results of similar quality to those of edena and velvet.
new rapid high-throughput sequencing technologies have sparked the creation of a new class of assembler.
qsra generally produced the highest genomic coverage, while being faster than vcake.
