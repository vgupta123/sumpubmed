anatomical correlates of regeneration were assessed by: retrograde labelling of regenerating dorsal root ganglion  cells with diasp; immunostaining with pgp  <dig>  to visualise sensory reinnervation of plantar hindpaws; electron microscopic analysis of regenerating axons in tibial and digital nerves; and by silver-cholinesterase histochemical study of motor end plate reinnervation.
following sciatic nerve injuries, functional recovery was assessed by analysis of the toe-spreading reflex and cutaneous sensitivity to von frey hairs.
although a substantial body of evidence underpins this hypothesis, it is challenged by recent findings including strong expression of ng <dig> in regenerating peripheral nerve.
injury to these fibre tracts resulted in no difference between knockout and wild-type mice in the ability of cst axons or dc axons to enter or cross the lesion site.
none of the anatomical or functional analyses revealed significant differences between wild-type and knockout mice.
similarly, after dorsal root injury , most regenerating dorsal root axons failed to grow across the dorsal root entry zone in both transgenic and wild-type mice.
in the cns, we used anterograde tracing with bda to study corticospinal tract  axons after spinal cord injury and transganglionic labelling with ct-hrp to trace ascending sensory dorsal column  axons after dc lesions and a conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve.
these findings show that ng <dig> is unlikely to be a major inhibitor of axonal regeneration after injury to the cns, and, further, that ng <dig> is unlikely to be necessary for regeneration or functional recovery following peripheral nerve injury.
the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan ng <dig> blocks neurite outgrowth in vitro and has been proposed as a major inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the cns.
we studied axonal regeneration in the pns and cns of genetically engineered mice that do not express ng <dig>  and in sex and age matched wild-type controls.
