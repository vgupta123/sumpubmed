thirty-eight environmental and sixteen cattle faecal isolates, which were detected in four adjacent pens over a four-month period were sub-typed.
the aim of this study was to identify potential routes of dissemination of e. coli o <dig> using multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis .
strain diversity was observed within pens, individual cattle and the environment.
mlva could separate these isolates into broadly defined clusters consisting of twelve mlva types.
