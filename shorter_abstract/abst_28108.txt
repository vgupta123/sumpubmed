our phylogeny was finely resolved, especially for the n. confucianus-like species.
three geographic populations of n. confucianus and one of n. fulvescens were supported as genetically distinct in our species delimitation analyses, while three recognized species  were not strongly supported as distinct.
our results suggested that several genetically distinct species may be contained within the species currently known as n. confucianus and n. fulvescens.
in addition, the results of bayesian phylogenetics and phylogeography  for n. coninga, n. huang, and n. lotipes indicated that either inter-specific gene flow had occurred or imperfect taxonomy was present.
morphological examinations and morphometric analyses are warranted to examine the molecular results.
our data provided the first support for n. brahma and n. eha as sister species, an assignment that is congruent with their morphological similarities.
we extensively sampled specimens of niviventer in china and neighboring northern vietnam, including topotypes of the most reported species , subspecies , and synonyms .
identification is extremely difficult, and a large number of genbank sequences seem to be problematic.
we estimated phylogenetic relationships on the basis of one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, using concatenation and coalescent-based approaches.
species delimitation analyses provided new insight into species diversity and systematics.
we also employed molecular species delimitation approaches to test the existence of cryptic and putative new species.
