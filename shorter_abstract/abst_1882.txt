we tested the effects of pedf on the survival of cultured adult rat rgcs in the presence of glaucoma-like insults, including cytotoxicity induced by glutamate or withdrawal of trophic factors.
pigment epithelium-derived factor  is a potent antiangiogenic, neurotrophic and neuroprotective protein that can protect neurons from a variety of pathologic insults.
the neuroprotective effect of pedf represents a novel approach for potential treatment of retinopathies, such as glaucoma.
trophic factor withdrawal also caused a similar loss of rgcs .
we demonstrated that pedf potently and efficaciously protected adult rat rgcs from glutamate- and trophic factor withdrawal-mediated cytotoxicity, via the activation of the nfκb and erk1/ <dig> pathways.
inhibitors of the nuclear factor κb  and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/ <dig>  significantly reduced the protective effects of pedf.
progressive death of rgcs occurs in glaucoma and several other retinal diseases, which can lead to visual impairment and blindness.
cultured adult rat rgcs exposed to glutamate for  <dig> days showed signs of cytotoxicity and death.
retinal ganglion cells  are responsible for the transmission of visual signals to the brain.
