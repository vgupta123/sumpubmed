however, at limiting peptide concentrations dr <dig> was more effective in t cell stimulation.
the major allergen, art v  <dig>  contains only one single immunodominant, solely hla-dr-restricted t cell epitope .
to understand the predominance of hla-dr <dig> in mugwort allergy in spite of the degeneracy in hla/peptide-binding and tcr-recognition, we investigated the molecular background of art v 125- <dig> /mhc/tcr interactions in the context of hla-dr <dig> compared to -dr <dig>
the frequency of hla-drb1* <dig> is highly increased in mugwort-allergic individuals and hla-dr <dig> serves as restriction element for art v 125- <dig>  however, art v 125- <dig> also binds to hla-dr <dig> with high affinity and dr1-restricted art v 125- <dig> -specific t cell receptors can be activated by hla-dr <dig> molecules.
mugwort pollen allergens represent the main cause of pollinosis in late summer.
in addition, the minimal epitope for 50% of art v 125- <dig> -specific t cells was shorter for dr <dig> than for dr <dig>  in vitro binding assays of art v 125- <dig> mutant peptides to isolated dr1- and dr4-molecules indicated similar binding capacities and use of the same register.
