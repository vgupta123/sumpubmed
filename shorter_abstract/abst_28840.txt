such discrepancy reflects developmental, morphological and physiological differences between mouse and human tissues.
we describe here a new strategy to study allele-specific dna methylation in the human placenta for the discovery of novel imprinted genes.
imprinted expression for aim <dig> was conserved in the cynomolgus macaque placenta, but not in other macaque tissues or in the mouse.
both genes showed maternal allele-specific methylation and paternal allele-specific transcription.
our study indicates that while there are many genomic regions with allele-specific methylation in tissues like the placenta, only a small sub-set of them are associated with allele-specific transcription, suggesting alternative functions for such genomic regions.
