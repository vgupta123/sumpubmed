connectivity mapping  has been used widely in cancer drug discovery and generally has relied on cancer cell line gene expression and drug phenotype data.
future research is needed to investigate the use of these cmap and similar analyses for determining combination therapies that might work synergistically to kill cancer cells and to apply this in silico bioinformatics approach using clinical outcomes to other cancer drug screening studies.
each gene signature was inputted into cmap software  to determine a set of drugs for which our signature “matches” the “reference” signature, and drugs that overlapped between the cmap analyses and the two studies were carried forward for validation studies involving drug screens on a set of  <dig> eoc cell lines.
therefore, we took a cmap approach based on tumor information and clinical endpoints from high grade serous eoc patients.
of the  <dig> drugs carried forward, five  were known a priori to be cytotoxics and were indeed shown to effect eoc cell viability.
we determined tumor gene expression signatures  associated with time to recurrence  among patients within tcga  and, separately, from the mayo clinic .
the standard treatment for patients with advanced eoc is initial debulking surgery followed by carboplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy.
epithelial ovarian cancer  is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women in the united states .
