we combine clinical observation data with drug target data, protein-protein interaction  networks, and gene ontology  annotations.
using cardiotoxicity as an example, we are able to further identify cardiotoxicity-related proteins among drug target expanding ppi networks.
our results also demonstrate the significance of incorporating prior knowledge, including gene networks and gene annotations, to improve future adr assessments.
our results show that an in silico model built on this framework can achieve a satisfactory cardiotoxicity adr prediction performance .
we use cardiotoxicity, one of the major causes for drug withdrawals, as a case study to demonstrate the power of the framework.
the use of ppi networks can increase prediction specificity and the use of go annotations can increase prediction sensitivity.
biomolecular network and gene annotation information can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of adr of drugs under development.
