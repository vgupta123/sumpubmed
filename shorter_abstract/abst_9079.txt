felids are its only definitive hosts and a wide range of mammals and birds serve as intermediate hosts.
to determine whether merozoites utilize distinct suites of genes to attach, invade, and replicate within feline enterocytes, we performed comparative transcriptional profiling on purified tachyzoites and merozoites.
in all other intermediate hosts, however, bradyzoites differentiate exclusively to tachyzoites, and disseminate extraintestinally to many cell types.
in contrast, a large set of surface proteins  was expressed exclusively in merozoites.
however, significant stage-specific expression differences were measured, with  <dig> transcripts exclusive to merozoites versus  <dig> exclusive to tachyzoites.
