in contrast, the expression of ha-ran did not show obvious variation at various developmental stages in four tissues by immunoblotting analysis, except in the midgut, which showed increased expression from 5th- <dig> h  to 6th- <dig> h. both expressions of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran could be upregulated by 20e in vitro.
immunohistochemistry revealed that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran were primarily localized in the nucleus of various tissues.
these evidences suggested that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran participated in the 20e signal transduction pathway by regulating the location of ecr-b <dig>
the nuclear location of the ecdysone receptor b <dig>  was also blocked after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran.
