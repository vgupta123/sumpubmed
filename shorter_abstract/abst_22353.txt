this study investigated the role of low-frequency electrical stimulation on satellite cell activity during a  <dig> d hindlimb suspension in rats.
daily application of electrical stimulation  partially attenuated the reduction of the fiber cross-sectional area, satellite cell activity, and myonuclear domain .
this study shows that electrical stimulation partially attenuated the decrease in muscle size and satellite cells during hindlimb unloading.
the causal relationship between satellite cell activation and electrical stimulation remain to be established.
mechanical unloading resulted in a 44% reduction in the myofiber cross-sectional area as well as a 29% and 34% reduction in the number of myonuclei and myonuclear domains, respectively, in the soleus muscles .
the ability of skeletal muscle to grow and regenerate is dependent on resident stem cells called satellite cells.
the number of quiescent , proliferating , and differentiated  satellite cells was also reduced by 48-57% compared to the weight-bearing animals .
it has been shown that chronic hindlimb unloading downregulates the satellite cell activity.
