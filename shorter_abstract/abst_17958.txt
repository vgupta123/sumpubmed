this paper compares the transcriptional profiles of zhongshuang  <dig> and zhongyou  <dig> for  <dig> genes that are principally involved in lipid biosynthesis during seed development in order to elucidate how the transcriptional profiles of these genes responded to quality improvement over the past  <dig> years.
it also resulted in altered relationships between these genes during storage accumulation in seed development.
with the selective pressure against fatty acid composition and oil content, high erucic acid- and low oil-content cultivars have been replaced by low erucic acid- and high oil-content cultivars.
the upgrading of rapeseed cultivars has resulted in a substantial improvement in yield and quality in china over the past  <dig> years.
selective pressure for zero erucic acid, low glucosinolate, high oleic acid and high oil content, as well as high yield, resulted in higher fad <dig>  accase, fae <dig>  gktp, caleosin, gapdh, and pepc expression levels and lower kas <dig>  β-ct, bcrk <dig>  p <dig>  fata, oleosin, fad <dig>  fatb, α-ct and suc <dig> expression levels.
most of the genes showed significant correlation with fatty acid accumulation, but the correlation in zs <dig> was significantly different from that in zy <dig>  higher kcr <dig> activity is associated with higher c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  and c18: <dig> in both cultivars, lower c22: <dig> and total fatty acid content in zy <dig>  and lower 18: <dig> in zs <dig>
both cultivars showed similar transcription profiles, with the napin gene predominantly transcribed.
the napin gene alone accounted for over 75% of total transcription from all  <dig> genes assessed in both cultivars.
this paper illustrates the response of the transcription levels of  <dig> genes to breeding in developing rapeseed seeds.
