here, this is addressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche theory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of resources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing individuals .
a common approach employed to describe viral quasispecies is by means of the quasispecies equation .
we observe that the population distribution requires very long transients both to a) reach equilibrium and b) to show a clear dominating master sequence.
using this novel combination of rme plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping for describing a quasispecies we explore the population distributions of viral variants that emerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics.
in turn, a problem with the rme is how to quantify the interaction coefficients between viral variants.
some dose of cooperation among viral variants is needed.
viral quasispecies can be regarded as a swarm of genetically related mutants.
this can be overcome by an alternative formulation for the evolutionary dynamics: the replicator-mutator equation .
in order to get a typical quasispecies profile, at least within the considered mathematical approach, it seems that pure competition is not enough.
we show that a useful quantity to calibrate the degree of cooperation is the shannon entropy.
