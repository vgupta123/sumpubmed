the suite employs logistic regression models in conjunction with user-adjustable cutoffs to accurately separate true snps and indels from sequencing and mapping errors with high sensitivity .
in addition to a command line version, the suite has been integrated into the genboree workbench, allowing biomedical scientists with minimal informatics expertise to remotely call, view, and further analyze variants through a simple web interface.
whole exome capture sequencing allows researchers to cost-effectively sequence the coding regions of the genome.
we have implemented the atlas <dig> suite and applied it to  <dig> whole exome samples from the  <dig> genomes project.
