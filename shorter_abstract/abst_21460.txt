it represents approximately 40 % of coffee production worldwide.
the genetic characterization based on snp markers of the varieties grown throughout the world, increased our knowledge on the genetic diversity of c. canephora, and contributed to the understanding of the genetic background of varieties from very important coffee producers.
while the genetic diversity of wild c. canephora has been well studied in the past, only few studies have addressed the genetic diversity of currently cultivated varieties around the globe.
we used a multivariate analysis using snp data from reference accessions in order to confirm and further fine-tune the genetic diversity of c. canephora.

given the common genetic origin of the robusta varieties cultivated in vietnam, mexico and uganda, and the similar characteristics of climatic areas and relatively high altitude where they are grown, we can state that the vietnamese and the mexican robusta have the same genetic potential to produce good cup quality.
the coffee species coffea canephora is commercially identified as “conilon” when produced in brazil, or “robusta” when produced elsewhere in the world.
through the use of sequencing-based diversity array technology-dartseq method-on a collection of c. canephora composed of known accessions and accessions cultivated in vietnam and mexico,  <dig>  polymorphic snps were identified.
also, by interpolating the data obtained for the varieties from vietnam and mexico, we determined that they are closely related to each other, and identified that their genetic origin is the robusta congo – uganda group.
knowledge of the genetic origin of robusta cultivated varieties in countries as important as vietnam and mexico is therefore of high interest.
