we subsequently performed genome-wide differential expression analysis and applied a monte carlo simulation algorithm and target prediction to identify a sox2-linked mirna regulome, which was strongly enriched with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  markers.
to improve our understanding of the sox2-linked mirna regulatory network as a contribution to the phenotype of these cell types, we used high-throughput differential mirna and gene expression analysis combined with existing genome-wide sox <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitation  data to map the sox <dig> mirna transcriptome in two human embryonal carcinoma cell  lines.
sox <dig> is furthermore a crucial factor in the maintenance of adult stem cell phenotypes and has additional roles in cell fate determination.
sox <dig> is a core component of the transcriptional network responsible for maintaining embryonal carcinoma cells  in a pluripotent, undifferentiated state of self-renewal.
additionally, several deregulated mirnas important to emt processes had sox <dig> binding sites in their promoter regions.
as such, sox <dig> is an oncogenic transcription factor and crucial cancer stem cell  biomarker in embryonal carcinoma and, as more recently found, in the stem-like cancer cell component of many other malignancies.

the sox2-linked microrna  transcriptome and regulome has not yet been fully defined in human pluripotent cells or cscs.
