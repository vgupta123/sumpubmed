moreover, we detected dna laddering in the transgenic plants at  <dig> hours after yoeb induction, indicative of apoptosis.
the results presented here mark an important milestone towards the development of a cell ablation based bio-containment strategy, which may be useful for functional studies and for the control of spread of transgenic plants.
overexpression of the chromosomally-encoded yoeb toxin from the yefm-yoeb toxin-antitoxin locus of the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae has been shown to cause cell death in s. pneumoniae as well as e. coli.
expression of the yoeb toxin from streptococcus pneumoniae is lethal in arabidopsis.
chromosomally-encoded toxin-antitoxin systems are involved in bacterial stress responses and activation of the toxins usually leads to cell death or dormancy.
examination of plants by fluorescent confocal microscopy showed gfp fluorescence in all parts of the leaves at  <dig> hours after 17-β-estradiol induction, continuing up to plant death.
quantitative rt-pcr analysis revealed that the expression of the yoeb toxin gene peaked at  <dig> days after induction with 17-β-estradiol, coinciding with the onset of visible effects on the plants.
