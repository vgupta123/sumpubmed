here we present the chip-seq command line tools and web server, implementing basic algorithms for chip-seq data analysis starting with a read alignment file.
the various chip-seq command line tools and web services either complement or compare favorably to related bioinformatics resources in terms of computational efficiency, ease of access to public data and interoperability with other web-based tools.
the chip-seq server is accessible at http://ccg.vital-it.ch/chipseq/.
the chip-seq tools have a modular and interoperable design in that the output from one application can serve as input to another one.

the web interface provides access to a large database of public data.
to make sense out of it, biologists need versatile, efficient and user-friendly tools for access, visualization and itegrative analysis of such data.
