we present a whole-genome sequence and analyses of an ethnic pathan from the north-west province of pakistan.
a total of  <dig>  million single nucleotide variations  and  <dig>  million small indels were identified by comparing with the human reference genome.
we analyzed the first ethnic male pathan genome by sequencing it to  <dig> -fold coverage using the illumina hiseq <dig> platform.
we confirmed that the pathan genome presented here is representative of this ethnic group by comparing it to a panel of central asians from the hgdp-ceph panels typed for ~650Â k snps.
this region is inhabited by a number of distinct ethnic groups, the largest being the punjabi, pathan , sindhi, and baloch.
finally, we reconstruct the demographic history by psmc, which highlights a recent increase in effective population size compatible with admixture between european and asian lineages expected in this geographic region.
snvs were annotated for health consequences and high risk diseases, as well as possible influences on drug efficacy.
