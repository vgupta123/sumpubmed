we constructed three high density linkage maps for two corymbia species  which were used to compare genome structure between both species and eucalyptus grandis.
we performed comparative genomics between the eucalypt genera eucalyptus and corymbia.

our results will facilitate transfer of genomic information between these important taxa and provide further insights into the rate of structural change in tree genomes.

previous studies suggest genome structure is largely conserved between eucalyptus species.
genome structure was highly conserved between the corymbia species.
nonetheless, in the general context of plants, the genomic structure of the two genera was remarkably conserved; adding to a growing body of evidence that conservation of genome structure is common amongst woody angiosperms.
however, it is unknown if this conservation extends to more divergent eucalypt taxa.
