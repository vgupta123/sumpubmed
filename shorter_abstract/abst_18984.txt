in this study, a mathematical model of disease progression was developed based on experimental data of clinical symptoms, immunological responses, and parasite load for leishmania amazonensis in balb/c mice.
our model can be used to identify the biological factors that must be changed to minimize parasite load in the host body, and contributes to the design of effective therapies.
the who considers leishmaniasis as one of the six most important tropical diseases worldwide.
the model obtained helps to quantify relationships between the selected variables, leads to a better understanding of disease progression, and aids in the identification of crucial points for introducing therapeutic methods.
it is caused by parasites of the genus leishmania that are passed on to humans and animals by the phlebotomine sandfly.
subsequently, the model robustness was tested and the model predictions were verified by comparing them with experimental observations made in different experimental conditions.
parameters were determined to minimize error in the model dynamics and time series experimental data.
