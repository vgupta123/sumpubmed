grrs identified in l. angustifolius contained a low number of interspersed repeats and had a high level of synteny to the genome of the model legume g. max.
during the last decade, l. angustifolius genomic studies have achieved several milestones, such as molecular-marker development, linkage maps, and bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries.
these findings will be valuable to the forthcoming sequencing of the lupin genome.
in contrast, in the clones with dispersed fish signals, more than one-third of sequences were transposable elements.
our results showed that not only was the gene nucleotide sequence conserved between soybean and lupin grrs, but the order and orientation of particular genes in syntenic blocks was homologous, as well.
bac clones selected by hybridization were subjected to restriction fingerprinting and contig assembly, and  <dig> bac-ends were sequenced and annotated.
here, these resources were integratively used to identify and sequence two gene-rich regions  of the genome.
bac fluorescence in situ hybridization  identified eight single-locus clones.
sequenced, single-locus clones were used to develop  <dig> genetic markers, increasing the number of l. angustifolius chromosomes linked to appropriate linkage groups by five pairs.
the grrs showed strong and conserved synteny to glycine max duplicated genome regions, illustrated by both identical gene order and parallel orientation.
however, such probes are not useful for positional cloning, because they tend to hybridize to numerous loci.
the species has 2n =  <dig> chromosomes and its genome size is  <dig> mbp/1c.
