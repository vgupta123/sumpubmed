we show that the high polymorphism in the population in france is caused by a relatively recent invasion of a haplotype from a population in iran, rather than a selective sweep in germany.
our data support a scenario in which xpr <dig> is frequently subject to positive selection, possibly as a response to resistance development against recurrently emerging infectious viruses.
here we analyze xpr <dig> sequences and haplotypes from a broad sample of wild mouse populations of two subspecies, m. m. domesticus and m. m. musculus, to trace the origins of this distinctive polymorphism pattern.
during such an infection cycle, receptor variants that may convey viral resistance can be captured from another population and quickly introgress into populations actively dealing with the infectious virus.
the invading haplotype codes for a novel receptor variant, which has itself undergone a recent selective sweep in the iranian population.
in a previous screen for selective sweeps in mouse populations we discovered that a population from germany was almost monomorphic for xpr <dig> haplotypes, while a population from france was polymorphic.
we focus here on the receptor gene xpr <dig>  for murine leukemia viruses .
