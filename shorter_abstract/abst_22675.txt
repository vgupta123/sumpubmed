multiplex rt-pcr is a valuable technique used for pathogen identification, disease detection and relative quantification of gene expression.
herein, we report multiplex one-step rt-pcr experiments in which the pcr primers contain thermolabile phosphotriester modification groups.
results reveal that the use of primers whose extension can be controlled in a temperature-mediated way provides improved one-step rt-pcr specificity in both singleplex and multiplex reaction formats.
however, intensive pcr optimization is often required to overcome competing undesired pcr primer extension during the rt step.
the presence of these groups minimizes pcr primer extension during the rt step and allows for control of pcr primer extension until the more stringent, elevated temperatures of pcr are reached.
the need for an accurate and sensitive technique to quantify mrna expression levels makes the described modified primer technology a promising tool for use in multiplex one-step rt-pcr.
