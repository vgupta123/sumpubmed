we devised the coulson plot, a new graphical representation that exploits a matrix of pie charts to display comparative genomics data.
while the coulson plot format is highly useful in comparative genomics, its original purpose, the software can be used to visualize any dataset where entity occupancy is compared between different classes.
a java-based application, the coulson plot generator  automates graphic production, with a tab or comma-delineated text file as input and generating an editable portable document format or svg file.
these patterns of retention and loss are highly informative for the prediction of function, and hence possible biological context, and can provide great insights into the evolutionary history of cellular functions.
