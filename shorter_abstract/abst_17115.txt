mutants identified using a fluorescence-based macrophage screen were further evaluated using gentamicin-based protection assay in macrophages, survival in the mouse splenic clearance model and growth in vitro to identify mutants with reduced growth rates.
the results of this work provide added insight with regard to the regulatory elements, nutritional demands and mechanisms required for efficient intracellular growth and survival of the organism.
transposons of the mariner family do not require species-specific host factors for efficient transposition, integrate nonspecifically at t/a base pairs, and, at a minimum, provide an alternative approach for gene discovery.
in this study, plasmid vector psc <dig>  containing both the hyperactive transposase c <dig> and transposon terminal inverted repeats flanking a kanamycin resistance gene, were used to deliver himar <dig> transposable element into the b. melitensis genome.
