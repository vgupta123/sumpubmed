to test the efficacy of the recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator  alteplase in horses, the thrombolytic effect was tested in in vitro generated equine thrombi.
in vitro, a dose dependent decrease of thrombus weight ranging from a  <dig>  % decrease for  <dig>  μg/ml to  <dig>  % decrease for 5 μg/ml rt-pa was noted.
these findings indicate that a single dose of 1 mg/kg alteplase results in rt-pa plasma concentrations comparable to those in humans and might be sufficient for a thrombolytic therapy in horses.
a single dose  was applied via intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes coagulation-related variables, blood count and clinical parameters were taken before the treatment and until 48 h after treatment.
the 1 mg/kg dose yielded the following pharmacokinetic parameters: cmax =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml; cl =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ml/min/kg; dominant half life  =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  minutes; median elimination half life  = 171 min ; auc =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg · min /ml.
