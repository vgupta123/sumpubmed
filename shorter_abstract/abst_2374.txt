here we describe a simple and novel approach to locate genome-wide cnvs common to a specific population, using human ancestry as the phenotype.
we developed a new methodology to identify common cnvs and demonstrated its performance by building a cacnv signature to predict human ancestry with high accuracy.
we identified a  <dig> cacnv signature using a training set of  <dig> healthy individuals from european, asian, and african ancestry.
the error rate in predicting ancestry in this test set was 2% using the  <dig> cacnv signature.
existing methods for cnv detection are often performed on a sample-by-sample basis, which is not ideal for large datasets where common cnvs must be estimated by comparing the frequency of cnvs in the individual samples.
we utilized our previously published genome alteration detection analysis  algorithm to identify common ancestry cnvs  and built a cacnv model to predict population structure.
copy number variations  are genomic structural variants that are found in healthy populations and have been observed to be associated with disease susceptibility.
the signature was validated on an independent test set of  <dig> individuals with similar ancestral background.
the utility of our approach could be extended to large caseâ€“control studies to identify cnv signatures for other phenotypes such as disease susceptibility and drug response.
