understanding these interactions may shed light on how intestinal microbes influence mammalian aging.
this study suggests that microbial folate synthesis is a pharmacologically accessible target to slow animal aging without detrimental effects.
consistent with this result, inhibition of folate synthesis by sulfamethoxazole, a sulfonamide, led to a dose-dependent increase in c. elegans lifespan.
we identified the disrupted gene to be arod, which is required to synthesize aromatic compounds in the microbe.
adding back aromatic compounds to the media revealed that the increased c. elegans lifespan was caused by decreased availability of para-aminobenzoic acid, a precursor to folate.
however, the microbe also limits c. elegans lifespan.
live e. coli provides the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans with vital micronutrients, such as folates that cannot be synthesized by animals.
serendipitously, we isolated an e. coli mutant that slows c. elegans aging.
as expected, these treatments caused a decrease in bacterial and worm folate levels, as measured by mass spectrometry of intact folates.
the folate cycle is essential for cellular biosynthesis.
