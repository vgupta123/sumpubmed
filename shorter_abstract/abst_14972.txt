these results suggest that ho- <dig> gene deletion protects neurons in mixed neuron-astrocyte cultures from heme-mediated oxidative injury.
exposure to hemin for  <dig> hours, a time point that preceded cell lysis, increased protein oxidation in wild-type cultures, as detected by staining of immunoblots for protein carbonyl groups.
selective inhibition of neuronal ho- <dig> may have a beneficial effect after cns hemorrhage.
cellular reactive oxygen species, detected by fluorescence intensity after dihydrorhodamine  <dig>  staining, was markedly increased by hemin in wild-type cultures and was localized to neuronal cell bodies and processes.
continuous exposure of wild-type cultures to 1– <dig> μm hemin for  <dig> h produced concentration-dependent neuronal death, as detected by both ldh release and fluorescence intensity after propidium iodide staining, with an ec <dig> of 1– <dig> μm; astrocytes were not injured by these low hemin concentrations.
neuronal death in wild-type cultures was almost completely prevented by the lipid-soluble iron chelator phenanthroline; deferoxamine had a weaker but significant effect.
cell death was consistently reduced by at least 60% in knockout cultures.
at  <dig> μm hemin, carbonylation was increased  <dig> -fold compared with control sister cultures subjected to medium exchanges only; this effect was reduced by about two-thirds in knockout cultures.
in contrast, dhr fluorescence intensity in knockout cultures did not differ from that of sham-washed controls.
the present study tested the effect of ho- <dig> gene deletion on protein oxidation, reactive oxygen species formation, and cell viability after mixed cortical neuron/astrocyte cultures were incubated with neurotoxic concentrations of hemin.
hemin, the oxidized form of heme, accumulates in intracranial hematomas and is a potent oxidant.
