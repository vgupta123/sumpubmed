whole genome amplification is an increasingly common technique through which minute amounts of dna can be multiplied to generate quantities suitable for genetic testing and analysis.
halobacterium species nrc- <dig> dna and campylobacter jejuni were amplified by several common, commercially available protocols: multiple displacement amplification, primer extension pre-amplification and degenerate oligonucleotide primed pcr.
for campylobacter jejuni, also analyzed at  <dig> base resolution, the d-statistics from genomiphi-amplified material were  <dig> times greater than those from unamplified material,  <dig>  times greater for repli-g,  <dig>  times greater for pep-pcr and  <dig>  times greater than the unamplified controls for dop-pcr.
here we utilized whole genome sequencing to assess amplification-induced bias in both coding and non-coding regions of two bacterial genomes.
the amplification-induced bias of each method was assessed by sequencing both genomes in their entirety using the  <dig> sequencing system technology and comparing the results with those obtained from unamplified controls.
all amplification methodologies induced statistically significant bias relative to the unamplified control.
