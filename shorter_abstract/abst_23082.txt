the papaya hermaphrodite-specific yh chromosome region  is pericentromeric and heterochromatic.
the 89% increase of dna sequence in hsy indicates rapid expansion of the yh chromosome after genetic recombination was suppressed 2– <dig> million years ago.
sex determination is controlled by a pair of nascent sex chromosomes with two slightly different y chromosomes, y for male and yh for hermaphrodite.
physical mapping of hsy and its x counterpart is essential for sequencing these regions and uncovering the early events of sex chromosome evolution and to identify the sex determination genes for crop improvement.

a reiterate chromosome walking strategy was applied to construct the two physical maps with three bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries.
the hsy physical map consists of  <dig> overlapped bacs on the minimum tiling path, and covers all four hsy-specific knobs.
this gap was filled on the physical map of the hsy corresponding region in the x chromosome.
the x physical map consists of  <dig> bacs on the minimum tiling path with one gap remaining in the middle, due to the nature of highly repetitive sequences.
this gap was filled on the hsy physical map.
the genetically defined borders coincide with the common bacs on the minimum tiling paths of hsy and x. the minimum tiling paths of hsy and its x counterpart are being used for sequencing these x and yh-specific regions.
the sex chromosome genotypes are xy , xyh , and xx .
one gap remained in the region of knob  <dig>  the only knob structure shared between hsy and x, due to the lack of hsy-specific sequences.
the genetically defined hsy spanned approximately  <dig>  mb, whereas its x counterpart extended about  <dig>  mb including a  <dig> kb region containing the knob  <dig> shared by the hsy and x. the  <dig>  mb hsy corresponds to  <dig>  mb of its x counterpart, showing 4 mb  dna sequence expansion.
