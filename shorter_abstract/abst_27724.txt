taking advantage of this fact, we used an evolutionary proteomics approach to identify amino acids important for cytokinin binding by looking for residues conserved in cytokinin receptors, but not in other receptors.
by comparing differences in evolutionary rates, we predicted five amino acids within the plant chase domains to be crucial for cytokinin binding.
mutagenesis of the predicted sites and subsequent binding assays confirmed the relevance of four of the selected amino acids, showing the biological significance of site-specific evolutionary rate differences.
we verified the hypothesis experimentally and identified four amino acids which are to a different degree required for ligand-binding of a plant hormone receptor.
the chase domain occurs not only in plant cytokinin receptors but also in numerous orphan receptors in lower eukaryotes and bacteria.
