these include complex patterns of gene expression within gene families, including the large family of variant surface glycoproteins  and their relatives, where we have identified a number of constitutively expressed family members.
despite the lack of gene regulation at the level of transcription initiation, our results reveal extensive regulation of mrna abundance associated with different life cycle and growth stages.
utilizing microarrays that have multiple copies of multiple probes for each gene, we were able to demonstrate with a high degree of statistical confidence that approximately one-fourth of genes show differences in mrna expression levels in the stages examined.
furthermore, we were able to assess the relative abundance of all transcripts in each stage, identifying the genes that are either weakly or highly expressed.
trypanosomatids represent a unique case in eukaryotes in that they transcribe protein-coding genes as large polycistronic units, and rarely regulate gene expression at the level of transcription initiation.
in addition, analysis of variant surface glycoprotein gene expression reveals a more complex picture than previously thought.
while differences in mrna expression have been described for many genes, genome-wide expression analyses have been largely lacking.
here we present a comprehensive analysis of mrna expression in several stages of parasite development.
