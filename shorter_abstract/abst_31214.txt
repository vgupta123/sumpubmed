sensing of foreign antigen by the antigen receptor on cd4+ t cells occurs during these cell-cell interactions.
in response to foreign antigen the cd4+ t cells proliferate, allowing the expansion of few antigen-specific primary cd4+ t cell clones.
lipid rafts contribute to the plasma membrane order and to its spatial asymmetry, as well.
to investigate the role of lipid raft-based membrane order in the clonal expansion phase of primary cd4+ t cells, we have disrupted membrane order by incorporating an oxysterol, 7-ketocholesterol , into the plasma membrane of primary cd4+ t cells expressing a t cell receptor specific to chicken ovalbumin323– <dig> peptide sequence and tested their antigen-specific response.
our findings suggest that lipid raft-based membrane order is important for clonal expansion of cd4+ t cells in response to a model peptide.

proliferating cd4+ t cells specialize in their function by undergoing differentiation into appropriate effectors tailored to mount an effective adaptive immune response against the invading pathogen.
we report that 7-kc, at concentrations that disrupt lipid rafts, significantly diminish the c-ovalbumin323– <dig> peptide-specific clonal expansion of primary cd4+ t cells.
lipid rafts are cholesterol and saturated lipid-rich, nanometer sized membrane domains that are hypothesized to play an important role in compartmentalization and spatiotemporal regulation of cellular signaling.
