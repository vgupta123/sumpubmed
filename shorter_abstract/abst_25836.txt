five groups of  <dig> mice each were immunised with saline , rcp <dig> , cp <dig> , a combination of cp <dig> and rcp <dig>  and a heterologous prime-boost strategy .
caseous lymphadenitis  is an infectious disease that affects small ruminants and is caused by corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.

thus, in this study, different vaccine formulations using a recombinant protein  and the cp <dig> live recombinant strain were evaluated.
rcp <dig> is a promising target in the development of vaccines against caseous lymphadenitis.
the g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> groups showed high levels of igg <dig> and igg2a; g <dig> presented significant igg2a production after virulent challenge in the absence of igg <dig> and igg <dig> induction.
