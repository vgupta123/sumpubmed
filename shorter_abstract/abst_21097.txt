most of the host defense peptides showed antibacterial activity against e.coli with dose-dependent efficacy.
β-defensin <dig> and cath <dig> displayed the strongest antibacterial activity among all tested chicken hdps.
host defence peptides are a diverse group of small, cationic peptides and are important elements of the first line of defense against pathogens in animals.
we examined the expression patterns of all known cathelicidins, β-defensins and nk-lysin in multiple selected tissues from chickens.
expression and functional analysis of host defense peptides has been evaluated in chicken but there are no direct, comprehensive comparisons with all gene family and individual genes.
cath <dig> through  <dig> were predominantly expressed in the bone marrow, whereas cathb <dig> was predominant in bursa of fabricius.
β-defensin1- <dig> expression was predominantly in bone marrow, whereas β-defensin8- <dig> and β-defensin <dig> were highly expressed in liver.
these results demonstrate dose-dependent antimicrobial effects of chicken hdps mediated by membrane damage and demonstrate the differential tissue expression pattern of bioactive hdps in chicken and the relative antimicrobial potency of the peptides they encode.
we synthesized peptide products of these gene families and analysed their antibacterial efficacy.
