wild type strains s. typhimurium 4/ <dig> and dtu <dig> were adapted to increasing concentrations of the biocide triclosan by serial passage.
medium level triclosan resistance could be obtained by fabi mutations in s. typhimurium, however, high level resistance was found to require sigma factor mutations in addition to a fabi mutation.
strains were genome sequenced, and snps in fabi, rpos and rpod were found to be associated with high level resistance.
however, work with defined mutants revealed that a snp in fabi was not sufficient to obtain high level resistance.
the current study aimed to identify genetic changes causing high level triclosan resistance in s. enterica serovar typhimurium and evaluate how these affected antibiotic resistance and efflux pump activity.
the adapted strains showed triclosan-dependent increased efflux, increased fabi expression and reduced susceptibility towards the antibiotics enrofloxacin and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim.
high level triclosan resistant isolates  were obtained.
this required additional mutations in the sigma factors rpos or rpod.
