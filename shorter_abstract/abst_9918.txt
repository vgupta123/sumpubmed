two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used for proteomic analysis and proteins were radioactively labelled with methionine to identify proteins only related to acid exposure.
a defined medium that supports the growth of a range of campylobacter strains and suitable for proteomic analysis was developed.
to allow added radioactive methionine to be incorporated into induced proteins, a modified chemically defined broth was developed with the minimal amount of methionine necessary for satisfactory growth of all strains.
during the transmission route from poultry to the human host, the major foodborne pathogen c. jejuni may experience many types of stresses, including low ph caused by different acids.
the aim of this study was to investigate the response to acid stress of three sequenced c. jejuni strains with different acid tolerances using hcl and acetic acid.
the most acid-sensitive isolate was c. jejuni  <dig>  followed by nctc  <dig> and isolate  <dig> as the most tolerant.
mainly proteins normally involved in iron control and oxidative stress defence were induced during acid stress of c. jejuni.
for strain nctc  <dig>  the induced proteins and the regulator fur were analysed at the transcriptomic level using qrt-pcr.
overall, induction of five proteins was observed within the pi range investigated:  <dig> kda periplasmic protein , thioredoxin-disulfide , a hypothetical protein cj <dig> , molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein , and bacterioferritin .
protein spots were analyzed using image software and identification was done with maldi-tof-tof.
in this transcriptomic analysis, only up-regulation of trxb and p <dig> was observed.
