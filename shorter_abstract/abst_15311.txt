in this study, a cdna library was constructed from the low-molecular weight rna isolated from the xcc strain  <dig> grown to exponential phase in the minimal medium xvm <dig>  seven srna candidates were obtained by sequencing screen of  <dig>  clones from the library and four of them were confirmed to be srnas by northern hybridization, which were named srna-xcc <dig>  srna-xcc <dig>  srna-xcc <dig>  and srna-xcc <dig>  the transcription start and stop sites of these srnas were further determined.
this work provides the first step toward understanding the role of srnas in the molecular mechanisms of xanthomonas campestris pathogenesis.
bioinformatics prediction showed that a large number of genes with various known or unknown functions in xcc  <dig> are potential targets of srna-xcc <dig>  srna-xcc <dig> and srna-xcc <dig>  in contrast, only a few genes were predicted to be potential targets of srna-xcc <dig>
we have identified four novel srnas from xcc by a large-scale screen.
xanthomons campestris pathovar campestris  is the causal agent of black rot disease of cruciferous crops.
in bacteria, small non-coding rnas  have been recognized as important regulators of various cellular processes.
