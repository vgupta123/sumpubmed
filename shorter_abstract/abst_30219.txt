the cdna sequences are enriched in the following gene ontology functional categories: protein binding, hydrolase, transferase, and catalytic enzymes.
surprisingly, approximately 37% of the l. stagnalis sequences only have a tblastx hit in the est library of another snail species aplysia californica  even using a low stringency e-value cutoff at  <dig> .
using the same cutoff, approximately 67% of the cdnas have a blast hit in the ncbi non-redundant protein and nucleotide sequence databases , suggesting that one third of the sequences may be unique to l. stagnalis.
finally, using the same cutoff , more than half of the cdna sequences  do not have a hit in nematode, fruitfly or human genome data, suggesting that the l. stagnalis transcriptome is significantly different from these species as well.
however, a serious drawback in the molecular analysis of the nervous system of l. stagnalis has been the lack of large-scale genomic or neuronal transcriptome information, thereby limiting the use of this unique model.
in this study, we report  <dig>  distinct est sequences  of a normalized l. stagnalis central nervous system  cdna library, resulting in the largest collection of l. stagnalis neuronal transcriptome data currently available.
the l. stagnalis cns est database is available at .
the annotated sequences contribute 12% of the predicted transcriptome size of  <dig> .
