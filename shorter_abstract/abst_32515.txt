in contrast to other eukaryotes, the giardia genome has only a single class of core histone genes that encode replication-independent histones.
there are two classes of core histone genes in higher eukaryotes: dna replication-independent histones and dna replication-dependent ones.
competition gel-shift experiments suggest that a factor within the protein complex that binds him may also be a part of the protein complexes that bind other promoter elements described previously in giardia.
the giardia core histone genes are constitutively expressed at approximately equivalent levels and their mrnas are polyadenylated.
the copies of each gene share extensive dna sequence identities throughout their coding and 5' noncoding regions, which suggests these copies have arisen from relatively recent gene duplications or gene conversions.
we identified two copies each of the core histone h2a, h2b and h <dig> genes, and three copies of the h <dig> gene, at separate locations on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> within the genome of giardia intestinalis, but no gene encoding a h <dig> linker histone could be recognized.
we determined that a  <dig> bp region upstream from the start of the histone h <dig> coding region is the minimal promoter, and a highly conserved  <dig> bp sequence called the histone motif  is essential for its activity.
giardia intestinalis is a protist found in freshwaters worldwide, and is the most common cause of parasitic diarrhea in humans.
our inability to locate a gene encoding the linker histone h <dig> leads us to speculate that the h <dig> protein may not be required for the compaction of giardia's small and gene-rich genome.
