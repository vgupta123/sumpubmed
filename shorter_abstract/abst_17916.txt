altogether, our observations uncovered the role of ntgnl1a in endocytosis, including endocytosis of pm proteins .
interestingly, brefeldin a , reported previously as an inhibitor of anterograde membrane trafficking in plants, appeared to be the most potent inhibitor of endocytosis in tobacco.
however, knowledge on the function and specificity of individual arf-gefs for individual steps of membrane trafficking pathways is still limited in plants.
in this work, treatments with various trafficking inhibitors showed that the endocytosis of fm 4â€“ <dig> is largely dynamin-dependent and relies on proteins containing endocytic tyrosine-based internalization motif and intact cytoskeleton.
in concert with this finding, we demonstrate that the point mutation in the sec <dig> domain of the gnom-like protein1a  confers intracellular trafficking pathway-specific bfa resistance.
