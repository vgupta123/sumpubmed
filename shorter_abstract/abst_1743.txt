since a transposon is able to pass chromosomal boundaries, only very few primary transposon-carrying transgenic lines are required for the establishment of large transposon tagging populations.
sequences obtained were blasted against the publicly available genome sequence of p. trichocarpa v <dig>   revealing possible transcripts for  <dig> variants.
we could demonstrate the power of the atds transposon approach and the simplicity to induce atds transposition in vitro.
thanks to bioinformatic analyses, prediction of gene models and protein-coding transcripts has become feasible.
various reverse and forward genetics strategies have been followed to determine the functions of these gene models and regulatory sequences.
in a second approach,  <dig> randomly selected individuals without any obvious phenotypic alterations were screened for atds excision.
here, large scale gene tagging resources are still lacking.
four activation-tagged populations comprising a total of  <dig>  individuals derived from  <dig> independent "activation tagging ds"  transgenic lines were produced and phenotyped.
the novel strategy of first genotyping and then phenotyping a tagging population as proposed here is, in particular, applicable for long-lived, difficult to transform plant species.
