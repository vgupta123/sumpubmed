third position gc content, and codon usage bias showed some sex-biased effects, primarily for autosomal genes expressed in the gonad.
sex-biased autosomal genes tended to be expressed at lower levels and in fewer tissues than unbiased gene targets, and autosomal somatic sex-biased genes had more expression noise than similar unbiased genes.
from the  <dig> significantly expressed coding regions that have been assigned to either the autosomes or the z chromosome , roughly 18% were significantly sex-biased in any one tissue, though only  <dig> gene targets were biased in all tissues.
finally, there were several over-represented gene ontology terms in the sex-biased gene sets.
