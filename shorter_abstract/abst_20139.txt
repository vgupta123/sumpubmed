there were no significant differences between trisomic fetuses with and without heart defects.
these alterations might be harbingers of the heart defects associated with hsa <dig> trisomy, which could be based on elusive mechanisms involving genetic variability, environmental factors and/or stochastic events.
however, the expression profile of hsa <dig> genes in trisomic human subjects as well as their effects on genes located on different chromosomes are largely unknown.
functional class scoring and gene set enrichment analyses of  <dig> genes, differentially expressed between trisomic and non-trisomic hearts, revealed downregulation of genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes and upregulation of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins.
we conclude that dosage-dependent upregulation of hsa <dig> genes causes dysregulation of the genes responsible for mitochondrial function and for the extracellular matrix organization in the fetal heart of trisomic subjects.
hsa <dig> gene expression was globally upregulated  <dig>  fold in trisomic samples.
using oligonucleotide microarrays we compared the gene expression profiles of hearts of human fetuses with and without hsa <dig> trisomy.
