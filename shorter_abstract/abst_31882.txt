although draft sequences are publicly available for a large number of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, the high sequence similarity of stx-converting bacteriophages with other lambdoid prophages poses challenges to accurately assess the organization and plasticity among stx-converting phages due to assembly difficulties.
the pst <dig> cluster contained phages related to those from e. coli o157:h <dig> strain sakai , and pst <dig> contained a single phage that was distinct from the rest but most related to the phage from e. coli o157:h <dig> strain ec <dig> .
the stx2a-converting phages of e. coli o157:h <dig> can be categorized into at least three phage types.
to further explore genome plasticity of stx-converting prophages, we enriched phage dna from  <dig> ciprofloxacin-induced cultures for subsequent  <dig> pyrosequencing to facilitate assembly of the complete phage genomes.
in total,  <dig> stx2a-converting phage genomes were closed.
polymorphisms between phage genomes may help explain differences in stx2a production between strains, however our data indicates that genes encoded external to the phage affect toxin production as well.
these nine psts formed three distinct clusters, designated as pst <dig>  pst <dig> and pst <dig>  the pst <dig> cluster, identified in two clade  <dig> strains, was related to stx2a-converting phages previously identified in non-o <dig> shiga-toxin producing e. coli  strains associated with a high incidence of hus.
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h <dig> is a foodborne pathogen that causes severe human diseases including hemolytic uremic syndrome .
the virulence factor that mediates hus, shiga toxin , is encoded within the genome of a lambdoid prophage.
