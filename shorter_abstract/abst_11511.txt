in both pig and chicken, an excess of genes affecting local immune defence were activated, though frequently these were down-regulated.
it is currently unknown whether females from these species share conserved mechanisms to tolerate such a lengthy presence of immunologically-foreign spermatozoa.
therefore, global gene expression was assessed using cdna microarrays on tissue collected from the avian utero-vaginal junction , and the porcine utero-tubal junction  to determine expression changes after mating  or in vivo cloacal/cervical infusion of sperm-free seminal fluid /seminal plasma .
spermatozoa are stored in the oviductal functional sperm reservoir in animals with internal fertilization, including zoologically distant classes such as pigs or poultry.
the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes of each treatment in each animal class were analysed for gene ontology.
