the protein-protein interaction  is one of the most important features to understand biological processes.
moreover, we applied pairpssm to identify ~ <dig>  homologous ppis with their interacting domains and residues in seven common organisms .
our pairpssm is able to provide statistical significance of residue pairs using evolutionary profiles and a scoring system for inferring homologous ppis.
the pairpssm can successfully distinguish the true protein complexes from unreasonable protein pairs with about 90% accuracy.
in this study, we proposed "pair position specific scoring matrix " to identify homologous ppis.
according to our best knowledge, the pairpssm is the first method for searching homologous ppis across multiple species using pair position specific scoring matrix and a 3d dimer as the template to map interacting domain pairs of these ppis.
in the post-genomic era, to rapidly identify homologous ppis for analyzing the contact residue pairs of their interfaces within ddis on a genomic scale is essential to determine ppi networks and the ppi interface evolution across multiple species.
for the test set including  <dig>  representative heterodimers and  <dig> , <dig> non-interacting protein pairs, the mean average precision and mean false positive rate of pairpssm were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
we believe that pairpssm is able to provide valuable insights for the ppi evolution and networks across multiple species.
