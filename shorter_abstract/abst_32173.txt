this has resulted in databases currently containing several hundred thousand microarray samples clustered by different species, manufacturers and chip generations.
likewise, the diversity of raw data deposited in public databases such as ncbi geo or ebi arrayexpress has grown enormously.
the virtualarray software package can combine raw data sets using almost any chip types based on current annotations from ncbi geo or bioconductor.
after establishing congruent annotations for the raw data, virtualarray can then directly employ one of seven implemented methods to adjust for batch effects in the data resulting from differences between the chip types used.
microarrays have become a routine tool to address diverse biological questions.
