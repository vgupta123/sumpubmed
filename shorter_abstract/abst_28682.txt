deeper analysis required for understanding the molecular mechanisms of all such condition specific co-expression relationships.
gene co-expression network analysis  is widely adopted in bioinformatics and biomedical research with applications such as gene function prediction, protein-protein interaction inference, disease markers identification, and copy number variance discovery.
in this paper, we present a linear algebraic based centralized concordance index  for evaluating the concordance of co-expressed gene modules from gene co-expression network analysis.
we applied cci in detecting lung tumor specific gene modules.
currently there is a lack of rigorous analysis on the mathematical condition for which the co-expressed gene module should satisfy.
the cci can be used to evaluate the performance for co-expression network analysis algorithms as well as for detecting condition specific co-expression modules.
the cci can be used to evaluate the performance for co-expression network analysis algorithms as well as forÂ detecting condition specific co-expression modules.
the application to lung cancer datasets revealed interesting potential tumor specific genetic alterations including cnvs and even hints for gene-fusion.
it is shown to be more robust to outliers and interfering modules than density based on pearson correlation coefficients.
