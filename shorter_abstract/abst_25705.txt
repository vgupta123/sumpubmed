gene co-expression networks have been used to describe the relationships between gene transcripts.
eigengene networks can be effective and biologically meaningful tools for studying the relationships between modules of a gene co-expression network.
second, we propose a method for constructing an eigengene network, where the edges are undirected but maintain information on the sign of the co-expression information.
third, we propose methods for differential eigengene network analysis that allow one to assess the preservation of network properties across different data sets.
we illustrate the value of eigengene networks in studying the relationships between consensus modules in human and chimpanzee brains; the relationships between consensus modules in brain, muscle, liver, and adipose mouse tissues; and the relationships between male-female mouse consensus modules and clinical traits.
we show that network methods can also be used to describe the relationships between co-expression modules and present the following methodology.
in some applications, we find that module eigengenes can be organized into higher level clusters which we refer to as meta-modules.
there is evidence that genes and their protein products are organized into functional modules according to cellular processes and pathways.
the proposed methods may reveal a higher order organization of the transcriptome.
we represent the gene expression profiles of each module by an eigengene.
