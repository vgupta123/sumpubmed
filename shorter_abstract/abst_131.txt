with the advent of next-generation sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism  markers are widely used in the study of genetic diversity and genomics.
we used gbs to characterize patterns of genetic diversity and genomic features within c. melo.

we provide useful information to preserve endangered gene pools and to guide the use of germplasm in breeding.
we used snp data to describe, for each subpopulation, the average linkage disequilibrium  decay, and to highlight genomic regions possibly resulting from directional selection and associated with phenotypic variation.
the second subpopulation contains landraces of ‘barattiere’, a regional vegetable production that was never characterized at the dna level and we show was erroneously considered another form of chate melon.
analyses of genetic structure, principal components, and hierarchical clustering support the identification of three distinct subpopulations.
this is one of the oldest domesticated forms of c. melo, once widespread in europe and now exposed to the risk of genetic erosion.
the third subpopulation includes genotypes of winter melon .
finally, our findings lay a foundation for molecular breeding approaches and the identification of genes underlying phenotypic traits.
genetic analysis within each subpopulation revealed patterns of diversity associated with fruit phenotype and geographical origin.
melon  is one of the most important horticultural species, which includes several taxonomic groups.
one of them includes accessions known with the folk name of ‘carosello’, referable to the chate taxonomic group.
