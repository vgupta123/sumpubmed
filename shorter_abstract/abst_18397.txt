we therefore focused on manipulation of both endogenous and heterologous ft genes to develop a floral induction system where flowering would be inhibited until it was induced on demand.
we have thus demonstrated a controlled-inducible flowering system using a novel combination of endogenous and heterologous ft genes.
ft protein has been recently identified as an important component of the mobile flowering hormone, florigen, whose function is conserved across the plant kingdom.
first, we showed that constitutive expression of a heterologous ft gene , from the model legume medicago truncatula,  was able to rescue the amir-ft late-flowering phenotype.
in order to induce flowering in a controlled way, the fta <dig> gene was then expressed under the control of an alcohol-inducible promoter in the late flowering amir-ft plants.
our starting point was plants with strongly delayed flowering due to silencing of ft with an artificial microrna directed at ft   <cit> .
