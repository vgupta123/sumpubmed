besides the well-known neural habituation mechanisms, bottom-up driven attention plays an important role during auditory processing in noisy environments.
auditory evoked responses can be modulated by both the sequencing and the signal-to-noise ratio of auditory stimuli.
this bottom-up driven attention would allow us to track a certain auditory signal in noisy situations without voluntarily paying attention to the auditory modality.
with increasing noise level, this difference decreased and even vanished in the condition where noise intensity exceeded the tone intensity by  <dig> db.
here, we presented subjects tone stimuli of different frequencies, which were either concatenated in blocks of constant frequency or in blocks of randomly changing frequencies.
furthermore, under noisy conditions, the n1m latency was shorter in the constant sequencing condition compared to the random sequencing condition.
constant sequencing as well as intense masking sounds basically lead to n1m response amplitude reduction.
in silence, tones presented with random sequencing elicited a larger n1m response than tones presented with constant sequencing.
