we propose a novel method for incorporating quantitative information from ap-ms data into existing ppi inference methods that analyze binary interaction data.
our sampling framework extends the existing body of work on ppi analysis using binary interaction data to apply to the richer quantitative data now commonly available through ap-ms assays.
we validate our approach on three recent ap-ms data sets and demonstrate performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods.
we then apply the existing method of choice to each alternative outcome and aggregate results over the ensemble.
however, with few exceptions, these methods only analyze binary experimental data , neglecting quantitative information available from ap-ms such as spectral counts.
over the past decade, high-throughput experimental techniques have been developed to generate ppi maps at proteome scale, first using yeast two-hybrid approaches and more recently via affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry .
using a sampling-based approach, we model the uncertainty of interactions with low spectral counts by generating an ensemble of possible alternative experimental outcomes.
fruitful future directions may include investigating more sophisticated schemes for converting spectral counts to probabilities and applying the framework to direct protein complex prediction methods.
