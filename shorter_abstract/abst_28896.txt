these results confirm that medicago wrky tfs have broad roles in orchestrating metabolic responses to biotic stress, and that they also represent potentially valuable reagents for engineering metabolic changes that impact pathogen resistance.
levels of soluble and wall bound phenolic compounds and lignin were increased in all cases.
to investigate potential involvement of wrky tfs in signalling, we expressed four medicago wrky genes in tobacco.
wrky w <dig> also induced tobacco endo- <dig> -Î²-glucanase  and enhanced the systemic defense response to tobacco mosaic virus in transgenic tobacco plants.
exposure of medicago truncatula cell suspension cultures to pathogen or wound signals leads to accumulation of various classes of flavonoid and/or triterpene defense molecules, orchestrated via a complex signalling network in which transcription factors  are essential components.
jasmonate zim-domain  transcriptional regulators were highly induced by mj treatment.
