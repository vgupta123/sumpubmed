thus, we carried out a comparative genomic analysis of genome-wide dna methylation profiles in e <dig> and e <dig> tooth germ from miniature pigs using methylated dna immunoprecipitation-sequencing .
the present study provided a comprehensive analysis of the global dna methylation pattern of tooth germ in miniature pigs and identified candidate genes that potentially regulate tooth development from e <dig> to e <dig>
we observed different dna methylation patterns during the different developmental stages of pig tooth germ.
to date, little is known about the role of dna methylation in tooth development in large animal models.
functional analysis identified several signaling pathways and  <dig> genes that may be potential key regulators of pig tooth development from e <dig> to e <dig>
dna methylation is an important epigenetic modification critical to the regulation of gene expression during development.
