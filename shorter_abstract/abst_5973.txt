this shows that hyperactivity is not caused by a direct catalytic effect but rather by misregulation of cn-ii.
these findings define a common molecular mechanism for cn-ii hyperactivity, which provides a solid basis for targeted therapy of leukemia.
here, we present kinetic and structural properties of cn-ii variants that represent 75Â % of mutated alleles in patients who experience relapsed all .
enzyme kinetics measurements revealed that the mutants are consitutively active without need for allosteric activators.
x-ray crystallography combined with mass spectrometry-based techniques demonstrated that this misregulation is driven by structural modulation of the oligomeric interface within the cn-ii homotetrameric assembly.
