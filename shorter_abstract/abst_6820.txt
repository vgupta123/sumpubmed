the mined patterns present a significant biological relevance in terms of related biological processes, components and molecular functions in a species-independent manner.
the microarray datasets are usually presented in 2d matrices, where rows represent genes and columns represent experimental conditions.
based on dynamic population, this paper proposes a novel dynamic multi-objective immune optimization biclustering  algorithm to mine coherent patterns from microarray data.
the proposed dmoiob algorithm is an efficient tool to analyze large microarray datasets.
experimental results on two common and public datasets of gene expression profiles show that our approach can effectively find significant localized structures related to sets of genes that show consistent expression patterns across subsets of experimental conditions.
it achieves a good diversity and rapid convergence.
biclustering requires the optimization of two conflicting objectives , and a multi-objective artificial immune system capable of performing a multi-population search.
as a heuristic search technique, artificial immune systems  can be considered a new computational paradigm inspired by the immunological system of vertebrates and designed to solve a wide range of optimization problems.
