specifically, the presence of cover and substrate providing suitable traction in the corridor had positive effects on individual movement decisions.
individual back patterns also strongly affected movement decisions in interaction with the physical properties of the dispersal corridor.
we find that movement behaviour depends on the starting conditions, the physical properties of the dispersal corridor, and on the individualsâ€™ phenotype.
here, we investigate the speed of movement in relation to environmental and individual phenotypic properties in subadult common lizards .
our results highlight the importance of understanding the habitat resistance for movement patterns, with humid habitats with covering vegetation providing the best conditions to initiate movement in the common lizard.
movement behaviour can be influenced by a multitude of biotic and abiotic factors.
in addition, population effects, differences in back pattern phenotype and individual plasticity were identified as key parameters influencing movement behaviour.
