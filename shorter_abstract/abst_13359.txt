repression of the phop regulator was observed in n- <dig> in presence of rbl <dig>  further, rbl <dig> activated virulence genes located on the salmonella pathogenicity islands  <dig> and  <dig>  flagellar genes, however, were repressed by rbl <dig>  sequential expression of flagellar, spi  <dig> and fimbrial genes is essential for salmonella infection.
in this study, the interactions of rbl <dig> and salmonella enterica subsp.
bifidobacterium thermophilum rbl <dig> , a human fecal isolate and health promoting candidate shows antagonistic and protective effects against salmonella and listeria spec.
our study provides first insights into probiotic-pathogen interactions on global transcriptional level and suggests that deregulation of virulence gene expression might be an additional protective mechanism of probiotica against infections of the host.
