a consensus melon linkage map was developed through map integration, which contained  <dig> co-dominant markers in  <dig> linkage groups including  <dig> markers derived from the cucumber genome.
in this study, comparative genetic mapping between cucumber and melon was conducted to examine syntenic relationships of their chromosomes.
however, the marker orders in several syntenic blocks on these consensus linkage maps were not co-linear suggesting that more complicated structural changes beyond simple chromosome fusion events have occurred during the evolution of cucumber.
further characterization of the genomic nature of cucumis species closely related to cucumber and melon might provide a better understanding of the evolutionary history leading to modern cucumber.
using two melon mapping populations,  <dig> and  <dig> cucumber ssr markers were added onto previously reported f2- and ril-based genetic maps, respectively.
it was determined that cucumber chromosome  <dig> was syntenic to melon chromosome i. cucumber chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> each contained genomic regions that were syntenic with melon chromosomes iii+v+xi and iii+viii+xi, respectively.
likewise, cucumber chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> each was syntenic with genomic regions of two melon chromosomes previously designated as ii+xii, iv+vi, vii+viii, and ix+x, respectively.
cucumber, cucumis sativus l.  and melon, c. melo l.  are two important vegetable species in the genus cucumis .
syntenic relationships between melon and cucumber chromosomes were inferred based on associations between markers on the consensus melon map and cucumber draft genome scaffolds.
meanwhile, many structural changes may have occurred during the evolution of the remaining six cucumber chromosomes.
comparative mapping conducted herein supported the hypothesis that cucumber chromosomes may be the result of chromosome fusion from a 24-chromosome progenitor species.
cucumber is believed to have evolved from melon through chromosome fusion, but the details of this process are largely unknown.
both species have an asian origin that diverged approximately nine million years ago.
