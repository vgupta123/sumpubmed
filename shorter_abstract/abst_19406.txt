scanning electron microscopy of the hydrophobic conidial surfaces did not reveal evidence for the presence of typical hydrophobin 'rodlet' layers.
the mutants were tested for germination and growth under different conditions, formation of sclerotia, ability to penetrate and infect host tissue, and for spore and mycelium surface properties.
hydrophobin mutants in a variety of fungi have been described to show 'easily wettable' phenotypes, indicating that hydrophobins play a general role in conferring surface hydrophobicity to aerial hyphae and spores.
these data provide evidence that in b. cinerea, hydrophobins are not involved in conferring surface hydrophobicity to conidia and aerial hyphae, and challenge their universal role in filamentous fungi.
surprisingly, none of the b. cinerea hydrophobin mutants showed obvious phenotypic defects in any of these characters.
bhp <dig> belongs to the class i hydrophobins, whereas bhp <dig> and bhp <dig> are members of hydrophobin class ii.
hydrophobins are small, cysteine rich, surface active proteins secreted by filamentous fungi, forming hydrophobic layers on the walls of aerial mycelia and spores.
in the genome of the grey mould fungus botrytis cinerea, genes encoding three hydrophobins and six hydrophobin-like proteins were identified.
