electrophoretic mobility shift assays  suggested at least one region of the protein is responsible for protein-dna interactions with a tripartite dna binding site composed of three direct imperfect repeats.
results from mutagenesis experiments and emsa were compared to results of structural predictions and sequence analyses.
excision of the gifsy- <dig> phage requires three proteins, the gifsy- <dig> integrase , the gifsy- <dig> excisionase  protein, and host encoded integration host factor .
