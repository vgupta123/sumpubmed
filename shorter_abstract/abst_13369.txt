ten vw resistance qtl identified in a 4-year replicated study have added useful information to the understanding of the genetic basis of vw resistance in cotton.

a meta-analysis of qtls identified  <dig> qtl clusters including  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> qtl hotspots for resistance to vw, rkn and fw, respectively.
the number of qtls and qtl clusters on chromosomes especially in the a-subgenome was significantly correlated with the number of nucleotide-binding site  genes, and the distribution of qtls between homeologous a- and d- subgenome chromosomes was also significantly correlated.
twenty-eight disease resistance qtl clusters and  <dig> hotspots identified from a total of  <dig> qtls and linked ssr markers provide important information for marker-assisted selection and high resolution mapping of resistance qtls and genes.
root-knot nematodes  and reniform nematodes  cause the highest yield loss in the u.s. planting disease resistant cultivars is the most cost effective control method.
numerous studies have reported mapping of quantitative trait loci  for disease resistance in cotton; however, very few reliable qtls were identified for use in genomic research and breeding.
vasinfectum, respectively, are two most destructive diseases in cotton production worldwide.
the non-overlapping of most resistance qtl hotspots for different diseases indicates that their resistances are controlled by different genes.
this study first performed a 4-year replicated test of a backcross inbred line  population for vw resistance, and  <dig> resistance qtls were mapped based on a 2895 cm linkage map with  <dig> ssr markers.
