we constructed two small rna libraries prepared from wild type  and fuzz/lintless  cotton ovules, respectively.
seven families make up the vast majority of expressed mirnas in developing cotton ovules.
in addition, we identified  <dig> cell-type-specific novel mirna candidates in cotton ovules.
the present study is the first to deep sequence the small rna population of g. hirsutum ovules where cotton fibers initiate and develop.
our results support the importance of mirnas in regulating the development of different cell types and indicate that identification of a comprehensive set of mirnas in cotton fiber cells would facilitate our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for fiber cell initiation and elongation.
in addition to its industrial and agricultural importance, the fiber cell  also is a biological model system for exploring gene expression and regulation.
however, whether small rnas are involved in regulation of fiber cell development is unknown.
our study has demonstrated significant differences in expression abundance of mirnas between the wild-type and mutant, and suggests that these differentially expressed mirnas potentially regulate transcripts distinctly involved in cotton fiber development.
small rnas regulate many aspects of plant growth and development.
we adopted a deep sequencing approach developed by solexa  to investigate global expression and complexity of small rnas during cotton fiber initiation and development.
each library was sequenced individually and generated more than 6- <dig> million short sequences, resulting in a total of over  <dig> million sequence reads.
in total  <dig> unique target genes were predicted for most of conserved mirnas.
