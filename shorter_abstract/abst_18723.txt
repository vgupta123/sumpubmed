the periocular region of each animal was examined for unilateral or bilateral nasolacrimal duct fistula and the location, appearance and size of the lesions.
of  <dig> cattle examined,  <dig> had unilateral  or bilateral fistula .
an increased incidence of nasolacrimal duct fistula in the offspring of dam j and three of her sons  prompted a study to investigate the prevalence and clinical manifestation of this anomaly.
the findings suggest a hereditary cause of nasolacrimal duct fistula in brown swiss cattle.
one other animal had a large opening with an atypical shape and another had an abnormal medial canthus with several fistulous openings.
the dam j, bull b,  <dig> direct offspring of bulls a, b, and c and eight other direct and indirect offspring of cow j were examined.
the fistulae were located medial to the medial canthus of the eye and were  <dig> to 10 mm  in height and  <dig> to 12 mm  in length.
