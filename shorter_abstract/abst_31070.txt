however, microarray annotations, especially for non-commercial, non-traditional biomedical model organisms, are often dated.
this information is especially valuable for systems biology modeling in the non-traditional biomedical model organisms.
manual re-annotation of microarrays is impracticable and so we developed a computational re-annotation tool  to retrieve the most recent accession mapping files from public databases based on est clone names or accessions and rapidly generate database accessions for entire microarrays.
systems biology modeling from microarray data requires the most contemporary structural and functional array annotation.
in addition, most microarray analysis tools do not readily accept est clone names, which are abundantly represented on arrays.
arrayider allows rapid automated structural re-annotation of entire arrays and provides multiple accession types for use in subsequent functional analysis.
moreover, we decreased non-chicken functional annotations by  <dig> fold.
