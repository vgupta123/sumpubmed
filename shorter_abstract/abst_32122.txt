the phylogenetic position of the protura, traditionally considered the most basal hexapod group, is disputed because it has many unique morphological characters compared with other hexapods.
the phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences of  <dig> mitochondrial pcgs suggest s. erythranum failed to group with other hexapod groups.
in this study, the mitochondrial genome of sinentomon erythranum was sequenced, as the first proturan species to be reported.
eighteen of the  <dig> trnas are greatly reduced in size with truncated secondary structures.
the "cox1-cox2" pattern probably represents the ancestral state for all proturan mitogenomes, and suggests a long evolutionary history for the protura.
this has impeded phylogenetic studies on this taxon, as well as the evolution of the arthropod mitochondrial genome.
as a very small arthropod mitochondrial genome, its  <dig>  nucleotides encode  <dig> typical mitochondrial genes.
the gene order is novel among available arthropod mitochondrial genomes.
the mitochondrial genome of s. erythranum shows many different features from other hexapod and arthropod mitochondrial genomes.
although mitochondrial genome information has been used extensively in phylogenetic studies, such information is not available for the protura.
two tandemly repeated regions occur in the a+t-rich region, and both could form stable stem-loop structures.
a large block of genes has experienced inversion and another nearby block has been reshuffled, which can be explained by the tandem duplication and random loss model.
compared with other metazoan mtdna, it has the most biased nucleotide composition with t =  <dig> %, an extreme and reversed at-skew of - <dig>  and a gc-skew of  <dig> .
the most remarkable finding is that trnl <dig> is not located between cox <dig> and cox <dig> as observed in most hexapod and crustacean groups, but is between rrnl and nad <dig> as in the ancestral arthropod ground pattern.
