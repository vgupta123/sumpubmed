we have evaluated features valuable for pre-mirna prediction, such as the local secondary structure differences of the stem region of mirna and non-mirna hairpins.
utilizing these features and combining some improvements of the current pre-mirna prediction methods, we implemented a computational learning method svm  to build a high throughput and good performance computational pre-mirna prediction tool called mirfinder.
pseudoobscura pair-wise genome alignments showed that the tool can be used for genome wide pre-mirna predictions.
results from applying the tool for chicken/human and d. melanogaster/d.
the method built into the tool consisted of two major steps: 1) genome wide search for hairpin candidates and 2) exclusion of the non-robust structures based on analysis of  <dig> parameters by the svm method.
we have also established correlations between different types of mutations and the secondary structures of pre-mirnas.
