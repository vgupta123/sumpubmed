the b. anthracis genome sequence contains four putative lambdoid prophages.
we undertook this study in order to understand whether the four prophages are unique to b. anthracis and whether they produce active phages.
more than  <dig> geographically and temporally divergent isolates of b. anthracis and its near neighbors were screened by pcr for the presence of specific dna sequences from each prophage region.
every isolate of b. anthracis screened by pcr was found to produce all four phage-specific amplicons whereas none of the non-b.
the retention of all four putative prophage regions across all tested strains of b. anthracis is further evidence of the very recent emergence of this lineage and the prophage regions may be useful for differentiating the b. anthracis chromosome from that of its neighbors.
induction with mitomycin c increased the frequency of excision of one of the prophages by approximately  <dig> fold.
all four prophages appear to be defective since, mitomycin c induced culture did not release any viable phage particle or lyse the cells or reveal any phage particle under electron microscopic examination.
sybr-green real-time pcr assays indicated that prophage excision occurs at very low frequencies .
all four prophages can excise at low frequencies, but are apparently defective in phage production.
