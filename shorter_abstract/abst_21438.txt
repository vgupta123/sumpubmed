as part of a larger research program to identify virulence genes and candidates for vaccine development, a dna microarray was constructed using a subset of  <dig> genes from the draft genome sequence of a. salmonicida subsp.
we used microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations  to compare selected a. salmonicida sub-species and other aeromonas species from different hosts and geographic locations.
aeromonas salmonicida has been isolated from numerous fish species and shows wide variation in virulence and pathogenicity.
we have used the m-cgh technique to identify subsets of conserved genes from amongst this set of a. salmonicida virulence genes for further investigation as potential vaccine candidates.
salmonicida strain a <dig>  the microarray included genes encoding known virulence-associated factors in a. salmonicida and homologs of virulence genes of other pathogens.
results showed variable carriage of virulence-associated genes and generally increased variation in gene content across sub-species and species boundaries.
unlike other bacterial characterization methods that use a small number of gene or dna-based functions, m-cgh examines thousands of genes and/or whole genomes and thus is a more comprehensive analytical tool for veterinary or even human health research.
