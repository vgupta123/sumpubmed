cegma software identified  <dig> out of  <dig> ultra-conserved core proteins as ‘complete’ in the transcriptome assembly, showing a completeness of  <dig>  %.
the present work reported a de novo transcriptome assembly and global analysis focused on gene expression changes during initiation and formation of somatic embryos in camphor tree.
it could also serve as an important platform resource for further functional studies in plant embryogenesis.
the overall de novo assembly of cdna sequence data generated  <dig> transcripts, with an average length of 998 bp.

expression level analysis of  <dig> somatic embryogenesis-related genes indicated a high correlation between rna-seq and qrt-pcr data.
our previous work demonstrated that pretreatment of immature zygotic embryos with  <dig>  m sucrose solution for 72 h efficiently induced somatic embryo initiation in camphor tree.
a total of  <dig>  g high quality clean reads were obtained from cdna libraries of the three samples.
to better understand the molecular basis of somatic embryogenesis induced by osmotic stress, de novo transcriptome sequencing of three tissues of camphor tree  were conducted using illumina hiseq  <dig> platform.
somatic embryogenesis is a notable illustration of cell totipotency, by which somatic cells undergo dedifferentiation and then differentiate into somatic embryos.
comparative transcriptome analysis showed that a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the three samples.
differential expression of somatic embryogenesis-related genes indicates that sucrose induced somatic embryogenesis may share or partly share the mechanisms of somatic embryogenesis induced by plant hormones.
<dig> unigenes  with an average length of 680 bp were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology terms or metabolic pathways based on blastx search against nr, nt, swissprot, go, cog/kog, and kegg databases.
this study provides comprehensive transcript information and gene expression data for camphor tree.
a total of  <dig> genes previously annotated to be potentially involved in somatic embryogenesis were identified.
gene enrichment analysis showed significantly differential expression of genes responding to stress and stimulus.
