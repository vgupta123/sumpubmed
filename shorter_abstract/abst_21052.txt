in addition, amplification products were detected by visual inspection using sybrgreen and using a lateral flow dipstick, eliminating the need for gel electrophoresis.
a typical ladder-like pattern on gel electrophoresis was observed in all positive samples in contrast to the negative controls.
loop-mediated isothermal amplification , which is a novel isothermal dna amplification technique, is sensitive, specific, fast and requires no specialized laboratory equipment.
a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the diagnosis of citrus bacterial canker  was developed and evaluated.
aurantifolii strain c causes cbc type c. the early and accurate identification of those bacteria is essential for the protection of the citrus industry.
this method can be useful in the phytosanitary programs of the citrus industry worldwide.
citrus bacterial canker  is a major, highly contagious disease of citrus plants present in many countries in asia, africa and america, but not in the mediterranean area.
there are three types of citrus bacterial canker, named a, b, and c that have different genotypes and posses variation in host range within citrus species.
the cbc-lamp technique is a simple, fast, sensitive and specific method for the diagnosis of citrus bacterial canker.
the causative agent for type a cbc is xanthomonas citri subsp.
detection methods based on bacterial isolation, antibodies or polymerase chain reaction  have been developed previously; however, these approaches may be time consuming, laborious and, in the case of pcr, it requires expensive laboratory equipment.
aurantifolii, strain b causes type b cbc and xanthomonas fuscans subsp.
no cross reaction was observed with dna of other phytopathogenic bacteria.
