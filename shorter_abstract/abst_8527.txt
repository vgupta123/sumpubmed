in this study, we aimed to assess the therapeutic potential of a human striatal neural stem cell line  implanted in the r6/ <dig> transgenic mouse model of hd.
genetically modified animals should provide a more accurate representation of human hd, as they emulate the genetic basis of its etiology.
although the rapid brain atrophy and short life-span of the r6/ <dig> model constitute adverse conditions to detect potentially delayed treatment effects, significant technical hurdles, such as poor cell survival and differentiation, were also sub-optimal.
cell therapy is a potential therapeutic approach for several neurodegenetative disease, including huntington disease .
to evaluate the putative efficacy of cell therapy in hd, most studies have used excitotoxic animal models with only a few studies having been conducted in genetic animal models.
