population structure analyses on nguni cattle revealed  <dig> sub-populations with a possible sub-structure evident at k equal to  <dig>  four hundred and thirty three cnvs that formed  <dig> cnvrs ranging from 30 kb to 1 mb in size are reported.
to date, no such genomic characterization has been performed in indigenous south african nguni cattle.
illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip data was utilized to investigate genomic population structure and the prevalence of cnvs in  <dig> south african nguni cattle.
genes involved in a number of cellular components, biological processes and molecular functions are reported within cnvrs identified.
nguni cattle are recognized for their ability to sustain harsh environmental conditions while exhibiting enhanced resistance to disease and parasites and are thought to comprise of up to nine different ecotypes.
cnvs may explain part of the phenotypic diversity and the enhanced adaptation evident in nguni cattle.

copy number variations  are modifications in dna structure comprising of deletions, duplications, insertions and complex multi-site variants.
gene ontology analyses demonstrated a number of pathways to be represented by respective genes, including immune response, response to abiotic stress and biological regulation processess.
plink, admixture, r, gplink and haploview software was utilized for quality control, population structure and haplotype block determination.
