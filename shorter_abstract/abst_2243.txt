insertion sequences were not randomly distributed in the bacterial genomes and were found to transpose short distances from their original location  and pseudogenes were enriched in the vicinity of is elements.
iss encode the protein transposase, which facilitates the excision and reinsertion of iss in genomes, making these sequences a type of class i  mobile genetic elements.
our previous sequencing of the genome of the cyanobacterium ‘nostoc azollae’  <dig>  living in a tight perpetual symbiotic association with a plant , revealed the presence of an eroding genome, with a high number of insertion sequences  together with an unprecedented large proportion of pseudogenes.
to widen the scope, the is contents were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively in  <dig> other genomes representing both free-living and symbiotic bacteria.
in general, symbiotic organisms showed higher densities of is elements and pseudogenes than non-symbiotic bacteria.
morphologically complex cyanobacteria with large genomes showed higher frequencies of is elements, irrespective of life style.
iss are proposed to be involved in the reductive evolution of symbiotic prokaryotes.
to investigate the role of iss in the reductive evolution of ‘nostoc azollae’  <dig>  and potentially in the formation of pseudogenes, a bioinformatic investigation of the is identities and positions in  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes was conducted.
these findings suggest that iss facilitate the reductive evolution in for instance in the symbiotic cyanobacterium ‘nostoc azollae’  <dig> and in other obligate prokaryotic symbionts.
insertion sequences  are approximately  <dig> kbp long “jumping” genes found in prokaryotes.
