by contrast, the constrained estimation accounting for flux connectivity information reduces this misrepresentation and thereby yields improved model parameters.
parameter estimation and model selection are simultaneously carried out on the constrained optimization problem and yield realistic model parameters that are more likely to hold up in extrapolations with the model.
parameter values can be estimated from steady-state data or from dynamic data.
for instance, estimations of parameter values in pathway models, such as kinetic orders, rate constants, flux control coefficients or elasticities, from steady-state data are generally based on experiments that measure how a biochemical system responds to small perturbations around the steady state.
almost no literature has so far discussed the combined use of both steady-state and transient data for estimating parameter values of biochemical systems.
in this study we introduce a constrained optimization method for estimating parameter values of biochemical pathway models using steady-state information and transient measurements.
the unconstrained optimal estimates from dynamic data may fit the experiments well, but they do not necessarily maintain the connectivity relationships.
in contrast, parameter estimation from dynamic data requires time series measurements for all dependent variables.
the method combines transient metabolic profiles and steady-state information and leads to the formulation of an inverse parameter estimation task as a constrained optimization problem.
two case studies demonstrate the estimation results with and without flux connectivity constraints.
the constraints are derived from the flux connectivity relationships of the system at the steady state.
