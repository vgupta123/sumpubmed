screening the library with  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> ests/genes demonstrated that the library had good genome coverage.
this bac library and the improved linkage map with  <dig> dna markers not only supply an indispensable tool to the integration of physical and linkage maps, the fine mapping of qtl and map based cloning genes located in qtl of commercial importance, but also contribute to comparative genomic studies and eventually whole genome sequencing.
we reported herein a bacterial artificial chromosome  library and the mapping of bac clones to the linkage map.
in addition,  <dig> novel microsatellites each isolated from  <dig> bac clones were mapped onto the first generation linkage map.
a total of  <dig> bac clones were anchored on the linkage map with at least one bac clone on each linkage group.
we have constructed the first bac library for l. calcarifer and mapped  <dig> bac clones to the first generation linkage map.
this bac library consisted of  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb, representing  <dig> -fold haploid genome coverage.
its first generation linkage map has been applied to map qtl for growth traits.
