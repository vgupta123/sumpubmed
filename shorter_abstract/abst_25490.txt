many of these genes are involved in breakdown of emc proteins regulating angiogenesis, and may be used for further research on prognostic markers and molecular targets of gene therapy for cancers.
the similarity-driving genes are related to the outcomes of patients with lung cancer with a hazard ratio of  <dig>  .
the proposed method and its application show the potential of such meta-analyses in clinical studies of gene expression profiles.
three data sets for leukemia and the other six for different solid tumors are used to demonstrate our method, using established statistical techniques.
although prognostic biomarkers specific for particular cancers have been discovered, microarray analysis of gene expression profiles, supported by integrative analysis algorithms, helps to identify common factors in molecular oncology.
we describe a set of significantly similar ordered gene lists, representing outcome comparisons for distinct types of cancer.
this kind of similarity could improve the diagnostic accuracies of individual studies when sogl is incorporated into the support vector machine algorithm.
