in addition, trig is suitable for studying aberrant recombination in immune diseases.
to reduce ambiguity, trig applies a heuristic strategy and incorporates gene annotation to identify authentic alignments.
t cells and b cells are essential in the adaptive immunity via expressing t cell receptors and immunoglogulins respectively for recognizing antigens.
compared to the traditional multiplex pcr approach, race is free of primer bias, therefore can provide accurate estimation of recombination frequencies.
such analysis will provide accurate estimation of recombination events, which will benefit various immune studies directly.
however, all current tools assume regular recombination of the receptor genes, which is not always valid in data prepared using a race approach.
this brings new computational challenges, e.g., ambiguous alignments due to multiple hits to repetitive regions.
unlike all current programs, trig does alignments to the whole receptor gene instead of only to the coding regions.
on our own and public race datasets, trig correctly identified non-regularly recombined sequences, which could not be achieved by current programs.
trig takes into account non-regular recombination of t cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes, therefore is suitable for analyzing race data.
to handle the non-regular recombination events, a new computational program is needed.
reasonably, frequencies of the recombination events have been shown to predict immune diseases and provide insights into the development of immunity.
to recognize a wide variety of antigens, a highly diverse repertoire of receptors is generated via complex recombination of the receptor genes.
