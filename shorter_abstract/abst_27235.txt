we have developed a set of e. coli expression vectors with different solubility tags that allow for parallel cloning from a single pcr product and can be purified using the same protocol.
the set of e. coli expression vectors, encode for either a hexa-histidine tag or the three most commonly used solubility tags  and all with an n-terminal hexa-histidine sequence.
however, many of the commercial vectors encoding different solubility tags require different cloning and purification steps for each vector, considerably slowing down expression screening.
we have also incorporated a tev recognition sequence following the solubility tag domain, which allows for highly specific cleavage  of the fusion protein to yield native protein.
the result is a set of four rationally designed vectors, which can be used for streamlined cloning, expression and purification of target proteins in the laboratory and have the potential for being adaptable to a high-throughput screening.
to validate our vector system, we have cloned four different genes and also one gene into all four vectors and used small-scale expression and purification techniques.
we demonstrate that the vectors are capable of high levels of expression and that efficient screening of new proteins can be readily achieved at the laboratory level.
