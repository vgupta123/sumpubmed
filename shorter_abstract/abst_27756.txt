v45a, q182l, and v45a/q182l ecmuty mutants could not reduce the g:c to t:a mutation frequency of a muty mutant.
the substrate specificities are altered in v45a, q182l, and v45a/q182l ecmuty mutants.
however, in contrast to a previous report that mig.mthi thymine dna glycosylase can be converted to a muty-like adenine glycosylase by replacing two residues , both v45a and q182l ecmuty mutants did not exhibit any t/g or t/8-oxog glycosylase activity.
targeted mutagenesis study was performed to determine the substrate specificities of v45a, q182l, and v45a/q182l double mutant of ecmuty.
the double mutant exhibited an additive reduction in binding to both the a/g and a/go in comparison to the single mutants.
surprisingly, the v45a/q182l double mutant had similar binding affinities to t/g as the wild-type ecmuty.
both residues are spatially close to each other in the active site and are conserved in muty family proteins but not in methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum mig.mthi t/g mismatch dna glycosylase .
expression of the v45a mutant protein caused a dominant negative phenotype with an increased g:c to a:t mutation frequency.
both v45a and q182l mutants had substantially increased affinities towards t/g, however, they did not exhibit any t/g or t/8-oxog glycosylase activity.
v45a and q182l mutants had reduced binding and glycosylase activities for a/g and a/8-oxog mismatches and increased affinities towards t/g mismatch.
the dominant negative phenotype of v45a ecmuty mutant protein is probably caused by its increased binding affinity to t/g mismatch and thus inhibiting other repair pathways.
v <dig> and q <dig> of ecmuty are considered to be the key determinants of adenine specificity.
all three mutants had significantly lower binding and glycosylase activities for a/g and a/8-oxog mismatches than the wild-type enzyme.
these mutants were also tested for binding and glycosylase activities with t/g- or t/8-oxog-containing dna.
