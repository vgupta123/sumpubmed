we here report our experience in automating this process using na√Øve bayes classifiers trained on  <dig>  abstracts classified by domain experts.
we have implemented the classifier into the curation process determining if abstracts are clearly relevant, clearly irrelevant, or if no certain classification can be made, in which case the abstracts are manually classified.
this study provides both practical recommendations for users of text classification tools, as well as a large dataset which can serve as a benchmark for tool developers.
like similar projects in other knowledge domains, significant effort is spent on identifying which articles are relevant for this purpose.
by implementing text classification, we have sped up the reference selection process without sacrificing sensitivity or specificity of the human expert classification.
the immune epitope database contains information on immune epitopes curated manually from the scientific literature.
