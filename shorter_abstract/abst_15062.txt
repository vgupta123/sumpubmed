the results of the comparison are used to derive a propensity value for each residue which is correlated with the likelihood that the residue is part of a ligand binding site.
moreover, since our approach is orthogonal to those used in other programs, the pdbinder propensity value can be integrated in other algorithms further increasing the final performance.
the good performance on the unbound proteins is extremely important for real-world applications where the location of the binding site is unknown.
we show that pdbinder performs better than existing methods.
here we describe a knowledge-based method exploiting the observation that unrelated binding sites share small structural motifs that bind the same chemical fragments irrespective of the nature of the ligand as a whole.
pdbinder compares a query protein against a library of binding and non-binding protein surface regions derived from the pdb.
