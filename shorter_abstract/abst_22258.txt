based on observation of wild-type males and on genetic analysis, we have divided the sperm-transfer step of mating behavior into four sub-steps: initiation, release, continued transfer, and cessation.
by a series of transgenic site-of-action experiments, we found that motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord require unc- <dig> for the initiation of sperm transfer, and that unc- <dig> acts downstream or in parallel to the spv sensory neurons in this process.
here we extend our understanding of the sperm-transfer step of male mating behavior.
in addition to this neuronal requirement, we found that non-neuronal expression of unc- <dig>  in the male gonad, is necessary for the continuation of sperm transfer.
our allele, sy <dig>  is defective in two distinct sub-steps of sperm transfer: initiation and continued transfer.
we have shown both a neuronal and non-neuronal requirement for unc- <dig> in distinct sub-steps of sperm-transfer behavior.
our division of sperm-transfer behavior into sub-steps has provided a framework for the further detailed analysis of sperm transfer and its integration with other aspects of mating behavior.
by determining the site of action of unc- <dig> in sperm-transfer behavior, and its relation to the spv sensory neurons, we have further defined the cells and tissues involved in the generation of this behavior.
this behavior has been divided into the following steps: response, backing, turning, vulva location, spicule insertion, and sperm transfer.
we isolated an allele of unc- <dig>  a previously reported member of the sec1/munc- <dig>  family of proteins that is necessary for regulated exocytosis in c. elegans motor neurons.
