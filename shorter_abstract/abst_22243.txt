current dna sequencing methods offer a powerful tool for understanding the genetic background of rare diseases in domestic animals having a reference genome sequence available.
the clinical and pathological findings exactly matched the gross description given by previous reports on epitheliogenesis imperfecta and epidermolysis bullosa  in cattle.
rare diseases in livestock animals are traditionally poorly diagnosed.
histological and ultrastructural changes were consistent with eb junctionalis .
genetic analysis revealed a previously unpublished itgb <dig> loss-of-function mutation; the affected calf was homozygous for a  <dig>  kb deletion involving exons  <dig> to  <dig>  and the dam carried a single copy of the deletion indicating recessive inheritance.
the homozygous mutant genotype did not occur in healthy controls of various breeds but some heterozygous carriers were found among charolais cattle belonging to the affected herd.
a single case of congenital skin fragility in cattle was observed, necropsy, histological and ultrastructural examinations were carried out and whole genome sequencing was utilized to identify the causative mutation.

a single purebred female charolais calf with severe skin lesions was delivered full-term and died spontaneously after birth.
the mutant allele was absent in a representative sample of unrelated sires of the german charolais population.
