group ii rats were given csa at a dosage of  <dig> mg/kg body weight, orally for  <dig> days.
group iii rats were given sulphated polysaccharides at a dosage of  <dig> mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously for  <dig> days.
group iv rats were given sulphated polysaccharides simultaneously along with csa, as mentioned in group ii for  <dig> days.
the present investigation suggests the therapeutic potential of sulphated polysaccharides from marine brown algae "sargassum wightii" in cyclosporine a - induced liver injury.
this in turn led to enhanced levels of lipid peroxidation, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy guanosine and protein carbonyls, along with a decrease in atpase activities and alterations in lipid profile.
group i served as vehicle control.
the effect of sulphated polysaccharides on csa-induced hepatotoxicity was studied in adult male albino rats of wistar strain, and the animals were randomized into four groups with six rats in each.
a significant rise in the level of oxidants, along with a striking decline in both the enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants, marks the severity of oxidative stress in csa-induced rats.
csa provoked hepatotoxicity was evident from the decreased activities of hepatic marker enzymes.
