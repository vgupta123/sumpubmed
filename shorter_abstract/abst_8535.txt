while the functions of the other tcs elements in arabidopsis, such as histidine kinases , histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins  and a-type and b-type arrs are becoming evident, the role of arr <dig> is poorly understood.
with respect to their morphology and metabolite status, no significant difference in the developing seeds of the arr <dig> mutants was observed compared to wild type.
we present evidence that arr <dig> is a preferentially cytoplasmic protein, exclusively expressed in the chalaza of developing seeds.
our results favor the model that arr <dig> acts as a phospho-histidine phosphatase on specific ahps in the cytoplasm of arabidopsis chalaza cells.
the arabidopsis response regulator  <dig>  is one of two members of a recently defined novel group of two-component system  elements.
arr <dig> specifically interacts with ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> in yeast and living plant cells.
even when slightly mis-expressed, arr <dig> interferes with hormone homeostasis in non-chalaza tissues.
the genetic complementation of the arr <dig> mutants with a genomic arr <dig> fragment resulted in plants  with a pleiotropic phenotype of different penetrance.
