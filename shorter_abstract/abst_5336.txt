at the biological level, despite low concentrations and no apparent phenotypic effects, the significant impact of these xenobiotics on mosquito transcriptomes raise important questions about the 'hidden impact' of anthropogenic pollutants on ecosystems and consequences on vector control.
thirty millions  <dig> bp cdna tags were sequenced, mapped to the mosquito genome and clustered, representing  <dig> known genes and  <dig> additional clusters not located within predicted genes.
genes and molecular mechanisms potentially involved in xenobiotic response and insecticide tolerance were identified.
here, a combination of longsage and solexa sequencing was used to perform a deep transcriptome analysis of larvae of the dengue vector aedes aegypti exposed for  <dig> h to sub-lethal doses of three chemical insecticides and three anthropogenic pollutants.
genes encoding cuticular proteins, transporters, and enzymes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and detoxification processes were particularly affected.
the method used in the present study appears as a powerful approach for investigating fine transcriptome variations in genome-sequenced organisms and can provide useful informations for the detection of novel transcripts.
mosquitoes exposed to insecticides or anthropogenic pollutants showed considerable modifications of their transcriptome.
the control of mosquitoes transmitting infectious diseases relies mainly on the use of chemical insecticides.
