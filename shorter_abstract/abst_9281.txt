in addition, core body temperature was elevated.
in contrast, the group receiving no analgesic treatment after laparotomy demonstrated significant changes in telemetry electrocardiogram recordings: increased heart rate and decreased heart rate variability parameters pointed to sympathetic activation and pain lasting for  <dig> hours.
adult mice were subjected to laparotomy, either combined with pain treatment  or without pain relief.
body weight and food intake were reduced for  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively.
in conclusion, real-time telemetric recordings of heart rate and heart rate variability were indicative of mild-to-moderate post-laparotomy pain and could define its duration in our mouse model.
telemetrically measured locomotor activity was undisturbed in all animals, thus confirming that any pain experienced was of the intended mild level.
in this study, we investigated the use of telemetry to identify indicators of mild-to-moderate post-laparotomy pain.
pain of mild to moderate grade is difficult to detect in laboratory mice because mice are prey animals that attempt to elude predators or man by hiding signs of weakness, injury or pain.
