the overall topology is highly consistent with recent molecular hypotheses of shorebird phylogeny.
the relative position of these clades is unresolved in the strict consensus tree but a 50% majority-rule consensus tree indicates that the sandpiper clade is sister group to the gulls and allies whilst the plover group is placed at the base of the tree.
however, comparative studies depend on phylogeny to control for the effects of shared evolutionary history.
order charadriiformes  is an ideal model group in which to study a wide range of behavioural, ecological and macroevolutionary processes across species.
despite concerns over the robustness of supertrees , we believe that it provides a valuable framework for testing numerous evolutionary hypotheses relating to the diversity of behaviour, ecology and life-history of the charadriiformes.
the supertree hypothesis presented herein is  the only complete phylogenetic hypothesis of all extant shorebirds.
