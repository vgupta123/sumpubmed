this involves decomposing the spatial 3d image into segments that are assigned to unique processors, and matched to the 3d torus architecture of the ibm blue gene/l machine.
when running on a  <dig> ghz intel cpu, the task of 3d median filtering on a typical  <dig> megabyte dataset takes two and a half hours, whereas by using  <dig> nodes of blue gene, this task can be performed in  <dig>  seconds, a 478Ã— speedup.
if the throughput of the image processing stage is significantly increased, it can have a major impact in microscopy applications.
our parallel solution dramatically improves the performance of image processing, feature extraction and 3d reconstruction tasks.
