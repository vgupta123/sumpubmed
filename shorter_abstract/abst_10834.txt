the differentially expressed transcripts underlying the pleiotropic qtl regions could be potential targets for improving sorghum performance under limited n fertilizer through marker assisted selection.
composite interval mapping detected a total of  <dig> qtls for  <dig> agronomic traits tested under different nitrogen levels.
understanding the genetic variation of sorghum in response to limited nitrogen supply is important for elucidating the underlying genetic mechanisms of nitrogen utilization.
the phenotypic variation explained by individual qtl ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %.
co-localized regions affecting multiple traits were detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these potentially pleiotropic regions were coincident with the genomic regions of cloned qtls, including genes associated with flowering time, ma <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and ma <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  gene associated with plant height, dw <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  in these regions, rna sequencing data showed differential expression of transcripts related to nitrogen metabolism , glycolysis , seed storage proteins, plant hormone metabolism and membrane transport.
a bi-parental mapping population consisting of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  was used to map quantitative trait loci  influencing different agronomic traits evaluated under normal n  and low n  conditions.

a linkage map spanning 1614 cm was developed using  <dig> polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms  detected in the population using genotyping-by-sequencing  technology.
illumina rna sequencing data generated on seedling root tissues revealed  <dig> differentially expressed gene  transcripts between parents, of which  <dig> were mapped close to the qtl regions.
