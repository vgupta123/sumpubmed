the present study facilitates detailed functional studies of the amphioxus globins in order to trace conserved properties and specific adaptations of respiratory proteins at the base of chordate evolution.
genomic resources of branchiostoma floridae now facilitate the identification, experimental confirmation and molecular evolutionary analysis of its globin gene repertoire.
we show that b. floridae harbors at least fifteen paralogous globin genes, all of which reveal evidence of gene expression.
some amphioxus globin gene structures exhibit minisatellite-like tandem duplications of intron-exon boundaries , which may serve to explain the creation of novel intron positions within the globin genes.
previous biochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of an intracellular globin in notochord tissue and myotome of amphioxus, but the corresponding gene has not yet been identified.
in phylogenetic analyses, the amphioxus globin bflgb <dig> forms a common clade with vertebrate neuroglobins, indicating the presence of this nerve globin in cephalochordates.
in addition, possible amphioxus orthologs of the vertebrate globin x lineage and of the myoglobin/cytoglobin/hemoglobin lineage can be identified, including one gene as a candidate for being expressed in notochord tissue.
the identification of putative orthologs of vertebrate globin variants in the b. floridae genome underlines the importance of cephalochordates for elucidating vertebrate genome evolution.
