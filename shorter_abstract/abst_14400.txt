we show here how untargeted deep sequencing of foodstuff total genomic dna, followed by bioinformatic analysis of sequence reads, facilitates highly accurate identification of species from all kingdoms of life, at the same time enabling quantitative measurement of the main ingredients and detection of unanticipated food components.
our data suggest that deep sequencing of total genomic dna from samples of heterogeneous taxon composition promises to be a valuable screening tool for reference species identification and quantification in biosurveillance applications like food testing, potentially alleviating some of the problems in taxon representation and quantification associated with targeted pcr-based approaches.
an additional metagenomic step facilitates identification of traces from animal, plant and microbial dna including unexpected species, which is prospectively important for the detection of allergens and pathogens.
sequence data simulation and real-case illumina sequencing of dna from reference sausages composed of mammalian  and avian  species are able to quantify material correctly at the 1% discrimination level via a read counting approach.
