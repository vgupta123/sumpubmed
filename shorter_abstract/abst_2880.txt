using both publicly available and our own microarray datasets we analyzed the detection p-value and detection call values for  <dig> human kidney samples run on the u133a or u133plus <dig>  affymetrix microarrays .
for the cytokine genes, the frequency of detection in each sample group  was examined and revealed that a majority of cytokine related genes are not detectable in human kidney by microarray.
we conclude that, when analyzing microarray data from human kidney samples, genes generally expressed at low abundance  should be evaluated with more sensitive approaches such as rt-pcr.
using a subset of  <dig> mayo transplant samples, a group of seven transplant-related cytokines and eight non-cytokine genes were evaluated by real-time pcr .
in addition, our data suggest that the use of detection frequency cutoffs for inclusion or exclusion of microarray data may be appropriate when comparing microarray and rt-pcr gene expression data and p-value calculations.
in the kidney this is a concern for genes such as cytokines which dramatically influence the immune response but are often considered low abundance genes produced by a small number of cells.
we found that as microarray detection frequency decreased the correlation between microarray and rt-pcr data also decreased.
many studies have highlighted the need for novel software and statistical approaches to assess the measured gene expression.
microarrays provide a means to simultaneously examine the gene expression of the entire transcriptome in a single sample.
less attention has been directed toward whether genes considered undetectable by microarray can be detected by other strategies or whether these genes can provide accurate gene expression determinations.
for these  <dig> genes we compared the impact of decreasing microarray detection frequency with the changes in gene expression observed by both microarray and rt-pcr.
