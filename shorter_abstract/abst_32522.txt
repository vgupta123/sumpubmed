we propose a simple rule to flag these erroneous gene length predictions to facilitate automatic annotation.
focusing on  <dig> co-directional overlaps longer than  <dig> bps, we classified the erroneous ones into five categories: i) 5'-end extension of the downstream gene due to either a mispredicted start codon or a frameshift at 5'-end of the gene , ii) fragmentation of a gene caused by a frameshift , iii) 3'-end extension of the upstream gene due to either a frameshift at 3'-end of a gene or point mutation at the stop codon , iv) redundant gene predictions , v) 5' & 3'-end extension which is a combination of i) and iii) .
nevertheless we found some convergent long overlaps  that might be true overlaps, although an important part of convergent overlaps could be classified as group iii) .
across the fully sequenced microbial genomes there are thousands of examples of overlapping genes.
we also studied  <dig> divergent overlaps that could be classified as misannotations of group i).
only convergent orientation seems to permit some long overlaps, although convergent overlaps are also hampered by misannotations.
many of these are only a few nucleotides long and are thought to function by permitting the coordinated regulation of gene expression.
however, there should also be selective pressure against long overlaps, as the existence of overlapping reading frames increases the risk of deleterious mutations.
here we examine the longest overlaps and assess whether they are the product of special functional constraints or of erroneous annotation.
we analysed the genes that overlap by  <dig> bps or more among  <dig> fully-sequenced prokaryotic genomes.
