our approach enables mirnas identification that could have an important role in the development of breast cancer.
looking at the pairs of pathways that were found to be functionally related, we created a network of dependent pathways and we focused on identifying mirnas that could act as mirna drivers in a coordinated regulation process.
an important challenge in cancer biology is to understand the complex aspects of the disease.

biological pathways are important tools to reveal gene interaction and reduce the large number of genes to be studied by partitioning it into smaller paths.
