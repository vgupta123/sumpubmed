the genes encoding subunits of the respiratory complexes – nad <dig> to nad <dig>  cob, cox <dig> to cox <dig> and atp <dig> to atp <dig> – all showed high expression levels both in absolute numbers and after normalization.
here, we report the first de novo assembly and annotation of the complete mitochondrial genome from perennial ryegrass.

moreover, we identified  <dig> open reading frames larger than 300 bp and covering  <dig>  bp ,  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> tandem repeats,  <dig> pairs of large repeats, and  <dig> pairs of short inverted repeats.
moreover, the dna sequence of mitochondrial genomes has been established and compared for a large number of species in order to characterize evolutionary relationships.
the circular master molecule of the mitochondrial genome from perennial ryegrass presented here constitutes an important tool for future attempts to compare mitochondrial genomes within and between grass species.
perennial ryegrass  is one of the most important forage and turf grass species of temperate regions worldwide.
intact mitochondria from perennial ryegrass leaves were isolated and used for mtdna extraction.
our results also demonstrate that mitochondria of perennial ryegrass contain genes crucial for energy production that are well conserved in the mitochondrial genome of monocotyledonous species.
the expression analysis gave us first insights into the transcriptome of these mitochondrial genes in perennial ryegrass.
its mitochondrial genome is inherited maternally and contains genes that can influence traits of agricultural importance.
therefore, it is crucial to understand the organization of the mitochondrial genome and how it varies between and within species.
the mitochondrial genome was sequenced to a 167-fold coverage using the roche  <dig> gs-flx titanium platform, and assembled into a circular master molecule of  <dig>  bp.
a total of  <dig> proteins,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> rrnas are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, giving a total gene space of  <dig>  bp .
