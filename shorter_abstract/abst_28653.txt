these lexical patterns are matched with the generated sentences in order to extract ddis.
appositions and coordinate structures are interpreted based on shallow syntactic parsing provided by the umls metamap tool .
the increasing volume of the scientific literature overwhelms health care professionals trying to be kept up-to-date with all published studies on ddi.
information extraction  techniques can provide an interesting way of reducing the time spent by health care professionals on reviewing the literature.
subsequently, complex and compound sentences are broken down into clauses from which simple sentences are generated by a set of simplification rules.
nevertheless, no approach has been carried out to extract ddi from texts.
this paper describes a hybrid linguistic approach to ddi extraction that combines shallow parsing and syntactic simplification with pattern matching.
a pharmacist defined a set of domain-specific lexical patterns to capture the most common expressions of ddi in texts.
the lexical patterns achieve a reasonable precision , but very low recall .
a drug-drug interaction  occurs when one drug influences the level or activity of another drug.
to the best of our knowledge, this work proposes the first integral solution for the automatic extraction of ddi from biomedical texts.
