our approach produced a draft genome of  <dig> mb, recovering 82% of the genes present in the grapevine reference genome; in addition, we identified  <dig> novel genes.
given its importance, we sequenced it and implemented a novel strategy for the de novo assembly of its highly heterozygous genome.
this cultivar is also one of the most planted for fresh consumption and raisins production.
a large number of structural variants and snps were identified.
some of these genes are likely involved in embryo development, suggesting that they may contribute to seedlessness, a key trait for table grapes.
‘sultanina’ plays a pivotal role in modern table grape breeding providing the main source of seedlessness.
this work produced the first structural variants and snps catalog for grapevine, constituting a novel and very powerful tool for genomic studies in this key fruit crop, particularly useful to support marker assisted breeding in table grapes.
wine and table grape cultivars represent two divergent germplasm pools with different origins and domestication history, as well as differential characteristics for berry size, cluster architecture and berry chemical profile, among others.
80% of the repetitive sequences involved in structural variants and more than  <dig>  genes were affected in their structure by these variants.
grapevine  is the most important mediterranean fruit crop, used to produce both wine and spirits as well as table grape and raisins.
among them,  <dig>  were experimentally confirmed in ‘sultanina’ and six snps in other  <dig> table grape varieties.
