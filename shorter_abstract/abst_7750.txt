accordingly, since h-ns represses ygeh expression, ett <dig> expression is significantly increased in an hns mutant.
eila and ygeh proteins show a moderate similarity to hila and are encoded in pathogenicity islands from several e. coli strains, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic.
interestingly, this is not the rule for all ygeh proteins: the ygeh protein from the enterohaemorragic e. coli strain o <dig> appears to be non-functional.
ygeh expression is not influenced by growth osmolarity or temperature, and moderately increases in cells entering the stationary phase.
h-ns represses ygeh expression under all growth conditions tested, and binds with specificity to the ygeh promoter region.
we show that both e. coli  <dig> ygeh and eila proteins are able to functionally replace hila in salmonella.
the hila protein is the master regulator of the salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig> .
in the present work we characterize the ygeh protein from the enteroaggregative e. coli strain  <dig> .
e. coli  <dig> ygeh protein is functional and able to replace hila in salmonella.
