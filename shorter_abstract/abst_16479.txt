chromosome analysis indicates a normal diploid number.
the trpe cells are also immunoreactive to vimentin, cytokeratin and zonula occludens- <dig> antibodies.
the trpe cells do not grow in suspension or in soft agar.
the trpe cells are immortal, but still exhibit contact inhibition, serum dependence, monolayer growth and secrete an extra-cellular matrix.
the trpe cell line has been passaged up to  <dig> population doublings and was shown to be morphologically similar to primary cells.
degeneration of the retina has been shown to induce a variety of retinopathies, such as stargardt's disease, cone-rod dystrophy , retinitis pigmentosa , fundus flavimaculatus , best's disease and age-related macular degeneration .
they have been characterized to be of rpe origin by reverse transcriptase pcr and immunocytochemistry using the rpe-specific genes rpe <dig> and cralbp and rpe-specific proteins rpe <dig> and bestrophin.
this cell line may be a useful in-vitro research model for retinal maculopathies.
one of the cultures, named trpe, surpassed senescence and was further characterized to determine its viability as a model for retinal diseases.
they retain the in-vivo morphology, gene expression and cell polarity.
