similarly, in laminin- <dig> and dermal beta- <dig> integrin mutants, dermal papilla development and primary cilia formation are normal.
initiation of the hair follicle placode and its subsequent growth, maturation and cycling in post-natal skin requires signaling interactions between epithelial cells and adjacent dermal cells and involves shh signaling via the primary cilium.
our data provides support for a primary role of laminin- <dig> promoting hair follicle epithelial downgrowth without affecting dermal primary cilia and shh target gene induction.
previous reports have implicated laminins in hair follicle epithelial invagination.
blocking laminin  <dig> and  <dig> in bccs maintains primary cilia and shh signalling, but prevents invagination.
here we use a human bcc model system and mouse mutants to re-evaluate the role of laminin- <dig> in epithelial invagination in the skin.
