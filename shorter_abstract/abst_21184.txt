cucumis melo is sister to this australian/asian clade, rather than being close to african species as previously thought.
cucumis sativus evolved within this australian/asian clade and is phylogenetically far more distant from c. melo than implied by the current morphological classification.
analyses of combined chloroplast sequences  for  <dig> of the  <dig> genera of cucurbitaceae indicate that the genera cucumella, dicaelospermum, mukia, myrmecosicyos, and oreosyce are embedded within cucumis.
based on congruent nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies we conclude that cucumis comprises an old australian/asian component that was heretofore unsuspected.
this taxonomy forms the basis for all ongoing cucumis breeding and genomics efforts.
melon, cucumis melo, and cucumber, c. sativus, are among the most widely cultivated crops worldwide.
cucumis, as traditionally conceived, is geographically centered in africa, with c. sativus and c. hystrix thought to be the only cucumis species in asia.
molecular clocks indicate that the deepest divergences in cucumis, including the split between c. melo and its australian/asian sister clade, go back to the mid-eocene.
cucumber and its sister species, c. hystrix, are nested among australian, malaysian, and western indian species placed in mukia or dicaelospermum and in one case not yet formally described.
