several recombination hotspots were identified, notably pe_pgrs <dig> and pe_pgrs <dig>  evidence of positive selection was revealed in  <dig> pe/ppe genes, including epitopes potentially binding to major histocompatibility complex molecules.
the pe and ppe families are typified by their highly conserved n-terminal domains that incorporate proline-glutamate  and proline-proline-glutamate  signature motifs.
a further  <dig> reference m. tuberculosis complex genomes and long read sequence data were used to validate the approach.
approximately 10Â % of the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome is made up of two families of genes that are poorly characterized due to their high gc content and highly repetitive nature.
this, the first comprehensive study of the pe and ppe genes, provides important insight into m. tuberculosis diversity and has significant implications for vaccine development.
snp analysis revealed that variation in the majority of the  <dig> pe/ppe genes studied was consistent with lineage.
