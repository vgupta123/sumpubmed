due to a controlled process environment, sufficient data was available to accurately track the entire process leading to up to the final expression data.
we show the value of tracking multi-step high throughput operations by using this knowledge to detect and correct misidentified data on gene expression microarrays.
much of the microarray data published at stanford is based on mouse and human arrays produced under controlled and monitored conditions at the brown and botstein laboratories and at the stanford functional genomics facility .
to date, the brown and botstein laboratories and the stanford functional genomics facility have together produced  <dig>  large-scale  cdna microarrays.
nevertheless, as large datasets based on the stanford human array began to accumulate, a small but significant number of discrepancies were detected that required a serious attempt to track down the original source of error.
in this paper, we describe our statistical methods to detect the inconsistencies in microarray data that arise from process errors, and discuss our technique to locate and fix these errors.
process errors in any genome scale high throughput production regime can lead to subsequent errors in data analysis.
