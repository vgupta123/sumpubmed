here we present new paradigms of data separation based on construction of transcriptional regulatory networks for normal and abnormal cells using sequence predictions, literature based data and gene expression studies.
transcription factor-regulated gene links and centrality of genes on transcriptional networks can be used to differentiate between cell types.
we examined distributions of distances  in the transcriptional networks for gene subsets whose collective expression profiles could best separate each dataset into predefined groups.
we found that samples can often be separated based on these measures of gene centrality more robustly than using individual links.
we analyzed expression datasets from a number of diseased and normal cells, including different types of acute leukemia, and breast cancer with variable clinical outcome.
this approach carries the advantage of identifying key transcription factor-gene pairs with differential activity between healthy and diseased states rather than merely using gene expression profiles, thus alluding to processes that may be involved in gene deregulation.
