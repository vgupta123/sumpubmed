we therefore investigated the expression levels of sense and antisense transcripts in normal and malignant human breast epithelia using the affymetrix hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  and almac diagnostics breast cancer dsa microarray technologies as well as massively parallel signature sequencing  data.
the expression of more than  <dig> antisense transcripts were detected in normal breast duct luminal cells and in primary breast tumors substantially enriched for their epithelial cell content by dsa microarray.
orientation specific rt-qpcr of selected sas pairs validated their expression in several breast cancer cell lines and solid breast tumours.
to date, several databases of in silico defined human sense-antisense  pairs have appeared, however no study has focused on differential expression of sas pairs in breast tissue.
a corresponding sense transcript could be identified on dsa for  <dig> antisense transcripts.
disease-focused and antisense enriched microarray platforms  confirm the assumption that antisense transcription in the human breast is more prevalent than previously anticipated.
a positive correlation of differential expression between normal and malignant breast samples was observed for most sas pairs.
nevertheless, future studies will reveal whether the relative abundances of antisense and sense transcripts have regulatory influences on the translation of these mrnas.
of these sas pairs,  <dig> have not been previously reported.
