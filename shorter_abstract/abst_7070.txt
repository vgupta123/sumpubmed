iaoseq could be used to help us understand the complex regulatory mechanism mediated by overlapping transcripts.
for the same strand overlapping transcription, currently existing high-throughput methods are rarely available to distinguish which strand was present in the original mrna template.
overlapping transcription constitutes a common mechanism for regulating gene expression.
we developed a new tool  that is based on reads distributions along the transcribed regions to identify the expression levels of overlapping genes from standard rna-seq data.
the iaoseq results showed that the commonly used methods gave an average of  <dig>  fold overestimation of the expression levels of same strand overlapping genes.

compared with five commonly used quantification methods, iaoseq showed better performance in the estimation accuracy of overlapping transcription levels.
this work provides a useful tool for mining overlapping transcription levels from standard rna-seq libraries.
a major limitation of the overlapping transcription assays is the lack of high throughput expression data.
