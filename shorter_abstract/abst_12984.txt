genetic markers for t cells and helper t cells were acutely enriched in sd rats, while an rats expressed genes for th <dig> cells, cytotoxic t cells, nk cells, mast cells, il-1a, and il- <dig> at higher levels.
t cell inhibition combined with other neuroprotective treatment may thus be a promising therapeutic avenue.
in the present study, we evaluated locomotor recovery in sd and an rats following moderate spinal cord contusion.
athymic nude rats demonstrated greater locomotor function than sd rats only at 1 week post-injury, coinciding with peak t cell infiltration in immunocompetent rats.
acute enrichment of cell death-related genes suggested that sd rats undergo secondary tissue damage from t cells.
we put forth a model in which t cells facilitate early tissue damage, demyelination, and kv channel dysregulation in sd rats following contusion sci.
t cell-deficient athymic nude  rats exhibit improved functional recovery when compared to immunocompetent sprague–dawley  rats following spinal cord transection.
however, compensatory features of the immune response in an rats cause delayed tissue death and limit long-term recovery.
t cells undergo autoimmunization following spinal cord injury  and play both protective and destructive roles during the recovery process.

immunostaining for macrophage markers revealed no t cell-dependent difference in the acute macrophage infiltrate.
additionally, sd rats exhibited increased acute expression of voltage-gated potassium  channel-related genes.
