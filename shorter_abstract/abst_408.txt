the relative transcript abundance of ethylene biosynthesis genes and of ap2/erf genes was analysed during somatic embryogenesis for callus lines with different regeneration potential, in order to identify genes regulated during that process.
the gene expression markers of proliferating callus capacity to regenerate plants by somatic embryogenesis should make it possible to predict callus lines suitable to be used for multiplication.
the ap2/erf superfamily has been identified and classified in hevea brasiliensis.
the transcripts of erfs from group i, vii and viii were abundant at all stages of the somatic embryogenesis process.
this first characterization of the ap2/erf superfamily in hevea revealed dramatic regulation of the expression of ap2/erf genes during the somatic embryogenesis process.
a phylogenetic analysis comparing the sequences of the ap <dig> domains of hevea and arabidopsis genes enabled us to predict the function of  <dig> expression marker genes.
sixteen markers discriminated between normal and abnormal embryos and, lastly, there were  <dig> markers of conversion into plantlets.
the analysis of relative transcript abundance was carried out by real-time rt-pcr for  <dig> genes.
further functional characterization of these markers opens up prospects for discovering specific ap2/erf functions in the hevea species for which somatic embryogenesis is difficult.
ethylene production and signalling play an important role in somatic embryogenesis, especially for species that are recalcitrant in in vitro culture.
