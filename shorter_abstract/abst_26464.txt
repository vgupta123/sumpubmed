opwise estimates the amount of systematic error in bacterial microarray data by assuming that genes in the same operon have matching expression patterns.
although microarray data can contain large amounts of systematic error, operons provide an external standard and allow for reasonable estimates of significance.
differentially expressed genes are typically identified by analyzing the variation between replicate measurements.
in several bacterial data sets, significant amounts of systematic error are present, and replicate-based approaches overstate the confidence of the changers dramatically, while opwise does not.
these procedures implicitly assume that there are no systematic errors in the data even though several sources of systematic error are known.
opwise then performs a bayesian analysis of a linear model to estimate significance.
