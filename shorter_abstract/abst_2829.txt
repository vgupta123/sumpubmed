however, the power analyses of our fisher’s exact tests indicate that our partitioned data was underpowered, particularly in regards to the low number of e318g carriers, both ad cases and controls, in the cache county dataset.
multiple studies have attempted to locate novel variants in the psen <dig> gene that affect alzheimer's disease status.
we tested for association between e318g genotype and alzheimer’s disease status by running a series of fisher’s exact tests.
our logistic regression model found a positive but non-significant main effect for e318g .
in our fisher’s exact test, it appeared that apoeε <dig> carriers with an e318g allele have slightly higher risk for ad than those without the allele ; however, the 95 % confidence intervals of those estimates overlapped completely, indicating non-significance.
our calculations indicated that the overall sample used in the logistic regression models was adequately powered to detect the sort of effect sizes observed previously.

a vast number of genes regulate alzheimer’s disease, including presenilin  <dig> .
a recent study suggested that one of these variants, psen <dig> e318g , significantly affects alzheimer's disease status in a large case–control dataset, particularly in connection with the apoeε <dig> allele.
our study looks at the same variant in the cache county study on memory and aging, a large population-based dataset.
the interaction term between e318g and apoeε <dig> was also non-significant .
