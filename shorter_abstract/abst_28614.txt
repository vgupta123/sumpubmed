many computational resources integrate interaction data with additional information on molecular background.
study results underline the necessity for further enhancements of visualization integration in biochemical analysis tools.
only some web resources featuring graph visualization can be successfully applied to interactive visual analysis of protein-protein interaction.
we selected m = <dig> out of n = <dig> resources supporting visualization, and we tested against the following set of criteria: interoperability, data integration, quantity of possible interactions, data visualization quality and data coverage.
cpdb presents a comprehensive dataset and intact lets the user change the network layout.
bioinformatics has come up with a great amount of databases and tools that support analysts in exploring protein-protein interactions on an integrated level for knowledge discovery.
there are numerous and huge databases of protein-protein interactions used to gain insights into answering some of the many questions of systems biology.
