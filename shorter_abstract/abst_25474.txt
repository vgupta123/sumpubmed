as shown here, b. subtilis pts- <dig> is acting as an environmentally compatible plant protective agent without permanent effects on rhizosphere microbial community.
ecological adaptation and microbial community-preserving capacity are important criteria when assessing suitability of bio-inoculants for commercial development.
the root-colonizing bacillus subtilis pts- <dig> supported growth of tomato plants and suppressed soil-borne diseases.
representatives of the genus bacillus are increasingly used in agriculture to promote plant growth and to protect against plant pathogens.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
unfortunately, hitherto the impact of bacillus inoculants on the indigenous plant microbiota has been investigated exclusively for the species bacillus amyloliquefaciens and was limited to prokaryotes, whilst eukaryotic member of this community, e.g.
