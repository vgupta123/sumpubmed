however, other circumstances may dictate a different choice in some situations.
our experimentation compares the running times and distance efficiency of lloyd's k-means clustering and the progressive greedy k-means clustering.
this analysis was performed using both a gene expression level sample and on randomly-generated datasets in three-dimensional space.
based on our implementation, not just in processing time, but also in terms of mean squared-difference , lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm is more efficient.
data clustering is a powerful technique for identifying data with similar characteristics, such as genes with similar expression patterns.
