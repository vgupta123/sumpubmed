in the marine environment, where there are few absolute physical barriers, contemporary contact between previously isolated species can occur across great distances, and in some cases, may be inter-oceanic.
however, it is not known whether this represents a contemporary event, potentially driven by ecosystem changes in the antarctic, or a sporadic occurrence happening over an evolutionary time-scale.
a large number of snps displaying fixed or nearly fixed allele frequency differences among the minke whale species were identified from the sequence data.
five panels of putatively diagnostic markers were established on a genotyping platform for validation of allele frequencies; two panels  separating the two species of minke whale, and three panels  differentiating the three subspecies of common minke whale.
antarctic minke whales are genetically and morphologically distinct from the common minke found in the north atlantic and pacific oceans, and the two species are estimated to have been isolated from each other for  <dig> million years or more.
an example of this can be seen in the minke whale species complex.
this work has resulted in the development of a panel of novel diagnostic genetic markers to address inter-oceanic and global contact among the genetically isolated minke whale species and sub-species.
we successfully used whole genome resequencing to identify a panel of diagnostic snps which now enable us address this evolutionary question.
the approach used here, combining whole genome resequencing and high-throughput genotyping, represents a universal approach to develop similar tools for other species and population complexes.
