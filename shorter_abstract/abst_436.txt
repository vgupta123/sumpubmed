the viesab system plays a role in the inverse regulation of biofilm and virulence genes by controlling the concentration of the secondary messenger, cyclic-di-gmp.
insight into the function and regulatory mechanism of the viesab system improves our understanding of how v. cholerae controls gene expression as it transitions between the aquatic environment and human host.
additionally, we show that phosphorylation of the highly conserved asp residue in the receiver domain of vieb regulates the inhibitory activity of vieb.
one way v. cholerae senses changing external stimuli is through the three-component signal transduction system, viesab, which is encoded by the viesab operon.
vibrio cholerae is a facultative pathogen that lives in the aquatic environment and the human host.

while the sensor kinase, vies, and the response regulator, viea, behave similar to typical two-component phosphorelay systems, the role of the auxiliary protein, vieb, is unclear.
here we show that vieb binds to vies and inhibits its autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer activity thus preventing phosphorylation of viea.
the ability of v. cholerae to monitor environmental changes as it transitions between these diverse environments is vital to its pathogenic lifestyle.
