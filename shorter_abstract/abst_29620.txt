in contrast, pharmacological blockade of the hh pathway in mes cells resulted in lower expression of these genes.
we then determined that brg <dig> is recruited to a gli2-specific mef2c gene element in a hh signalling-dependent manner during cardiomyogenesis in p <dig> ec cells, a mes cell model.
thus, we propose a mechanism where hh/gli <dig> regulates the expression of mef2c by recruiting brg <dig> to the mef2c gene, most probably via chromatin remodelling, to ultimately regulate in vitro cardiomyogenesis.
to further assess the transcriptional role of hh signalling during cardiomyogenesis in stem cells, we studied the effects of overexpressing gli <dig>  a primary transducer of the hh signalling pathway, in mes cells.
mass spectrometric analysis identified the chromatin remodelling factor brg <dig> as a protein which co-immunoprecipitates with gli <dig> in differentiating mes cells.
stable gli <dig> overexpression resulted in an enhancement of cardiac progenitor-enriched genes, mef2c, nkx2- <dig>  and tbx <dig> during mes cell differentiation.
