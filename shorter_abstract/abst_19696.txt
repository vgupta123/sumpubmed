we present alfred-g, a greedy alignment-free distance estimator for phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on the concept of the generalized acs approach.
performance evaluation using real sequence datasets shows that our heuristic is able to reconstruct comparable, or even more accurate, phylogenetic tree topologies than the kmacs heuristic algorithm at highly competitive speed.
this algorithm is implemented in c++ and has been incorporated into our open-source alfred software package .
this acs approach has been further generalized by some recent work, either greedily or exactly, by allowing a bounded number of mismatches in the common substrings.
alignment-free sequence comparison approaches have been garnering increasing interest in various data- and compute-intensive applications such as phylogenetic inference for large-scale sequences.
