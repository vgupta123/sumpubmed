in the present study, we report on the draft genome of r. solani ag2-2iiib using the illumina technology.
the draft genome of r. solani ag2-2iiib has an estimated size of  <dig>  mb.
the established r. solani ag2-2iiib genome and est sequences provide important information on the gene content, gene structure and transcriptional activity for this sugar beet pathogen.
the r. solani ag2-2iiib genome encodes a high number of carbohydrate active enzymes.
this fungal species has a compatibility system regulating hyphal fusions .
the genome of r. solani ag2-2iiib was predicted to harbor  <dig>  genes and  <dig> were found to be isolate-specific.
r. solani ag2-2iiib was predicted to contain  <dig> putatively secreted proteins and  <dig> of them were found to be unique for this isolate.
transcription analysis of selected genes representing different enzyme clades revealed a mixed pattern of up- and down-regulation six days after infection on sugar beets featuring variable levels of resistance compared to mycelia of the fungus grown in vitro.
ag2-2iiib isolates are most aggressive on sugar beet.
sugar beet  is a crop cultivated for its high content in sugar, but it is vulnerable to many soil-borne pathogens.
genome analysis, interpretation and comparative genomics of five sequenced r. solani isolates were carried out.
consequently, r. solani species are categorized in anastomosis groups .
in addition, two normalized est libraries were sequenced.

in total  <dig>  of  <dig>  ag2-2iiib isotigs  were mapped on the genome with more than 95 % sequence identity.
