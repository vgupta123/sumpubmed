species which have larger body sizes and narrower habitat breadths, show both diurnal and nocturnal activities and more specialized dietary requirements, are more likely to exhibit upslope shifts in abundance-weighted range centres.
in this study, we examined the elevational range shifts at three range points  of rodents over a 30-year period , in a subtropical forest of southwest china.
however, so far very little is known about the distributional responses of subtropical species to climate change, especially for small mammals.
species’ distributional responses can be heterogeneous even though there are directional changes in climate.
our study also illustrates the merit of multi-faceted assessment in studying elevational range shifts.
we also examined the influences of four ecological traits  on the upslope shifts in species’ abundance-weighted range centres.
despite the warming trend between  <dig> and  <dig>  the  <dig> rodent species in analysis displayed heterogeneous dynamics at each of the three range points.
