the genomes of the b. pseudomallei strains k <dig> and dd <dig> were also found to contain boaa and inactivation of the gene in dd <dig> considerably decreased binding to monolayers of hep <dig> and a <dig> cells and to nhbe cultures.
a second yada-like gene product highly similar to boaa  was identified in the published genomic sequence of b. pseudomallei strain k <dig> .
additionally, a b. pseudomallei strain lacking expression of both boaa and boab was impaired in its ability to thrive inside j774a.
the boaa and boab genes specify adhesins that mediate adherence to epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract.
a well-studied aspect of pathogenesis by these closely-related bacteria is their ability to invade and multiply within eukaryotic cells.
comparative sequence analyses identified a gene product in the published genome of b. mallei strain atcc <dig>  that resembles the well-characterized yersinia enterocolitica autotransporter adhesin yada.
the boaa gene product is shared by b. pseudomallei and b. mallei whereas boab appears to be a b. pseudomallei-specific adherence factor.
in contrast, the means by which b. pseudomallei and b. mallei adhere to cells are poorly defined.
the gene specifying this protein, termed boab, appears to be b. pseudomallei-specific.
moreover, a boab mutant of b. pseudomallei dd <dig> showed decreased adherence to these respiratory cells.
consistent with these findings, disruption of the boaa gene in b. mallei atcc <dig> reduced adherence to all three cell types by ~50%.
<dig> murine macrophages, suggesting a possible role for these proteins in survival within professional phagocytic cells.
burkholderia pseudomallei and burkholderia mallei cause the diseases melioidosis and glanders, respectively.
the gene encoding this b. mallei protein, designated boaa, was expressed in escherichia coli and shown to significantly increase adherence to human epithelial cell lines, specifically hep <dig>  and a <dig> , as well as to cultures of normal human bronchial epithelium .
quantitative attachment assays demonstrated that recombinant e. coli expressing boab displayed greater binding to a <dig> pneumocytes, hep <dig> cells and nhbe cultures.
