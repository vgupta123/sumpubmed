they impair growth more severely at high ph, probably due to their increased uptake as membrane-permeant weak bases.
most of these base stress proteins were also regulated by spermidine, but only at ten-fold higher concentration  at high ph .
high ph amplifies polyamine stress; and naturally occurring polyamines may play an important role in base stress.
at or above ph  <dig>  spermine and spermidine regulate specific proteins, many of which are known to be regulated by base stress.
at ph  <dig> , however, e. coli survival was decreased 100-fold by  <dig> mm spermine, putrescine, cadaverine, or spermidine.
polyamines increase survival in extreme acid, but decrease e. coli survival in extreme base.
the role of ph is critical in understanding polyamine stress.
at ph  <dig> , spermine induced additional proteins: tnaa, ompa, yrda and nana  and also repressed  <dig> proteins.
growth inhibition by spermine and spermidine requires neutral or higher ph.
polyamines such as spermine and spermidine are required for growth of escherichia coli; they interact with nucleic acids, and they bind to ribosomes.
the effect of polyamines was tested on survival of escherichia coli k- <dig> w <dig> in extreme acid or base .
