inclusion of the α5-α <dig> helices/tmi domain  phenocopied bax 30– <dig> as it restored mitochondrial localization, bcl-xl independent cytotoxicity and was not dependent on endogenous bax-bak.
bax a pro-apoptotic member localizes as monomers in the cytosol of healthy cells and accumulates as oligomers in mitochondria of apoptotic cells.
removal of the tm domains  abrogated mitochondrial localization but resulted in bcl-xl regulated activation of endogenous bax and bax-bak dependent apoptosis.
bcl- <dig> family proteins are key regulators of mitochondrial integrity and comprise both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins.
deletion of  <dig> amino acids in the bax n-terminus  caused constitutive accumulation at mitochondria and triggered high levels of cytotoxicity, not inhibited by bcl-xl.
alanine substitutions of three residues  in the n-terminus  attenuated regulation by the serine-threonine kinase akt/pkb but not by bcl-xl indicative of distinct regulatory mechanisms.
the bcl- <dig> homology- <dig>  domain regulates interactions within the family, but regions other than bh <dig> are also critical for bax function.
regardless of regulation by bcl-xl, all n-terminal deleted constructs immunoprecipitated bcl-xland converged on caspase- <dig> dependent apoptosis consistent with mitochondrial involvement in the apoptotic cascade.
here we have investigated n-terminus modulation of tm function in the context of regulation by the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xl.
