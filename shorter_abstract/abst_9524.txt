we have previously combined statistical alignment and phylogenetic footprinting to detect conserved functional elements without assuming a fixed alignment.
considering a probability-weighted distribution of alignments removes sensitivity to alignment errors, properly accommodates regions of alignment uncertainty, and increases the accuracy of functional element prediction.
bigfoot extends a combined alignment and phylogenetic footprinting approach to analyze larger amounts of sequence data using mcmc.
the results exhibit how adding additional sequences to the analysis has the potential to improve the accuracy of functional predictions, and demonstrate how bigfoot outperforms existing alignment-based phylogenetic footprinting techniques.
we have developed a markov chain monte carlo  approach which samples both sequence alignments and locations of slowly evolving regions.
