we designed, validated and used synechocystis genome-wide oligonucleotide  microarray  to study transcriptional activity of the cyanobacterial genome in response to sulfur  starvation.
we made five main observations: 1) transcriptional changes upon sulfate starvation were relatively moderate, but significant and consistent with growth kinetics; 2) s acquisition genes encoding for a high-affinity sulfate transporter were significantly induced, while decreased transcription of genes for phycobilisome, photosystems i and ii, cytochrome b6/f, and atp synthase indicated reduced light-harvesting and photosynthetic activity; 3) s starvation elicited transcriptional responses associated with general growth arrest and stress; 4) a large number of genes regulated by s availability encode hypothetical proteins or proteins of unknown function; 5) hydrogenase structural and maturation accessory genes were not identified as differentially expressed, even though increased hydrogen evolution was observed.
the expression profiles recorded by using this oligonucleotide-based microarray platform revealed that during transition from the condition of plentiful s to s starvation, synechocystis undergoes coordinated transcriptional changes, including changes in gene expression whose products are involved in sensing nutrient limitations and tuning bacterial metabolism.
the microarray data were verified by quantitative rt-pcr.
characteristic transcriptional responses to changes in the growth environment are expected to provide a scaffold for describing the synechocystis transcriptional regulatory network as well as efficient means for functional annotation of genes in the genome.
however, these changes were unlikely due to the across-the-board, non-specific shut down of transcription in a condition of growth arrest.
the repression of certain s-related genes was paralleled by activation of genes involved in internal and external s scavenging.
the transcriptional profile of the nutrient starvation was dominated by a decrease in abundances of many transcripts.
