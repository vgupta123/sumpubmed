towards the aim of developing reproducible and reusable processes, data analysis management tools can help giving structure and coherence to complex data flows.
reproducibility in data analysis research has long been a significant concern, particularly in the areas of bioinformatics and computational biology.
its adoption, together with good development practices, can help improving data analysis management, sharing and reproducibility, especially in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology.
nonetheless, improved software quality comes at the cost of additional design and planning effort, which may become impractical in rapidly changing development environments.
the tool supports a data-centered philosophy that aims at improving analysis reproducibility and reusability with minimal design overhead.
the repo package constitutes an unobtrusive data and flow management extension of the r statistical language.
