two independent t-dna insertion mutants for wrky <dig> supported normal growth of a virulent strain of p. syringae but developed reduced disease symptoms after infection.
a common feature of plant defense responses is the transcriptional regulation of a large number of genes upon pathogen infection or treatment with pathogen elicitors.
a large body of evidence suggests that plant wrky transcription factors are involved in plant defense including transcriptional regulation of plant host genes in response to pathogen infection.
however, there is only limited information about the roles of specific wrky dna-binding transcription factors in plant defense.
we analyzed the role of the wrky <dig> transcription factor from arabidopsis in plant defense against the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae.
based on analysis of both t-dna insertion mutants and transgenic overexpression lines, stress-induced wrky <dig> functions as a negative regulator of sa-mediated defense responses to p. syringae.
these wrky25-overexpressing plants also displayed reduced expression of the sa-regulated pr <dig> gene after the pathogen infection, despite normal levels of free sa.
analysis of stress-induced wrky <dig> in the defense signaling mutants npr <dig>  sid <dig>  ein <dig> and coi <dig> further indicated that this gene is positively regulated by the salicylic acid  signaling pathway and negatively regulated by the jasmonic acid signaling pathway.
the nuclear localization and sequence-specific dna-binding activity support that wrky <dig> functions as a transcription factor.
by contrast, arabidopsis constitutively overexpressing wrky <dig> supported enhanced growth of p. syringae and displayed increased disease symptom severity as compared to wild-type plants.
this proposed role is consistent with the recent finding that wrky <dig> is a substrate of arabidopsis map kinase  <dig>  a repressor of sa-dependent defense responses.
