in vitro analysis showed, however, that the purified pof1p enzyme had no cytidylyltransferase activity but does have atpase activity, with catalytic efficiency comparable to other atpases involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of proteins .
according to the results, Δpof <dig> cells showed increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, heat shock and protein unfolding agents, such as dithiothreitol and tunicamycin.
taken together, the results strongly suggest that the biological function of pof1p is related to the regulation of protein degradation.
besides, the overexpression of pof <dig> suppressed the sensitivity of Δpct <dig>  a strain that lacks a gene that encodes a phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, to heat shock.
the objective of this work is to understand the molecular and biological function of this gene.
supporting these findings, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed a physical interaction between pof1p and ubc7p  in vivo.
