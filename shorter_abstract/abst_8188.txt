the method serves as a general computational tool for annotating large numbers of unknown genes, uncovering evolutionary and functional modules.
ce is estimated to allocate each of the  <dig> unannotated orthologs to kegg pathways with an average precision of 49%   an estimated 94% of the  <dig> unannotated orthologs in the cog ontology can be assigned a function with an average precision of  <dig>  or greater.
among the results are:  ce performs better than standard guilt by association  irrespective of the number of genes assigned ; improvement is greatest at high coverage where precision  of ce is approximately 6-fold higher than that of sga.
we introduce, test and apply a new decision rule, correlation enrichment , for assigning genes to functional categories at various levels of resolution.
the effectiveness with which phylogenetic profiles can be utilized to assign genes to pathways depends on an appropriate measure of correlation between gene profiles, and an effective decision rule to use the correlate.
it appears to perform substantially better than extant stand alone high throughout methods.
phylogenetic analysis is emerging as one of the most informative computational methods for the annotation of genes and identification of evolutionary modules of functionally related genes.
