one group received a moderate fat diet, containing pork lard and salmon oil  ratio  <dig> ) , while the other group was fed a high fat diet, containing pork lard and chicken fat  ratio  <dig> )  for 12 weeks.
oxidative stress and inflammation can be altered by dietary factors in various species.
however, little data are available in true carnivorous species such as domestic cats.
it was hypothesized that a high fat diet enhanced in n- <dig> pufa and with lower concentrations of antioxidants would evoke inflammation and oxidative stress in domestic cats.
as numerous anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative additives become available and might be of use in cats with chronic low-grade inflammatory diseases, the current study aimed to develop a model of diet-induced inflammation by use of two opposite diets.
prior to and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 weeks after starting the testing period, blood samples were collected.
these results point towards a resistance of cats to develop dietary fat-induced inflammation, but also suggest a high susceptibility to oxidative stress when fed a fish oil-supplemented diet even with moderate fat level and additional vitamin e.
this was associated with a reduced serum vitamin e status, as serum α-tocopherol concentrations were lower with mfn- <dig>  even with higher dietary levels of vitamin e. serum cytokine and serum amyloid a concentrations were not influenced by diet.
serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was higher when fed mfn- <dig> compared to the hfn- <dig>  suggesting augmented oxidative stress.
