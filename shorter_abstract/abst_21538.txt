the integrative analysis of multiple genomics data often requires that genome coordinates-based signals have to be associated with proximal genes.
we also present a novel method, rgmatch, a flexible and easy-to-use python tool that computes associations either at the gene, transcript, or exon level, applying a set of rules to annotate each region-gene association with the region location within the gene.
rgmatch can be applied to any organism as long as genome annotation is available.
the relative location of a genomic region with respect to the gene  is important for functional data interpretation; hence algorithms that match regions to genes should be able to deliver insight into this information.
rgmatch simplifies the association of a genomic region with its closest gene.
