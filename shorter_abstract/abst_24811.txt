when testing all birth cohorts together, only one significant cluster was detected.
we have found three spatial case clusters in the dutch bse epidemic.
the clusters are geographically distinct and each cluster appears in a different birth cohort.
in many of the european countries affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy , case clustering patterns have been observed.
the spatial clusters of bse cases are most likely due to time-dependent heterogeneities in exposure related to feed production.
significant spatial case clustering is present in the dutch bse epidemic.
the fact that we found stronger spatial clustering when using a cohort-based analysis, is consistent with the evidence that most bse infections occur in animals less than  <dig> or  <dig> months old.
