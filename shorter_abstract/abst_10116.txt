the large number of comparisons can lead to false positives.
various methods have been used to reduce false positives, but they have rarely been compared or quantitatively evaluated.
permutations to estimate false positives indicate that probe sets removed by the filter contribute a disproportionate number of false positives.
use of a threshold fraction of present detection calls  provided a simple method that effectively eliminated from analysis probe sets that are unlikely to be reliable while preserving the most significant probe sets and those turned on or off; it thereby increased the ratio of true positives to false positives.
our approach sets a threshold for the fraction of arrays called present in at least one treatment group.
here we describe and evaluate a simple method that uses the detection  call generated by the affymetrix microarray suite version  <dig> software  to remove data that is not reliably detected before further analysis, and compare this with filtering by expression level.
affymetrix genechipsÂ® are widely used for expression profiling of tens of thousands of genes.
experiment size greatly affects the ability to reproducibly detect significant differences, and also impacts the effect of filtering; smaller experiments  benefit from more restrictive filtering .
