ensemble modeling is a promising approach for obtaining robust predictions and coarse grained population behavior in deterministic mathematical models.
jupoets integrates simulated annealing with pareto optimality to estimate ensembles on or near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives.
jupoets can be adapted to solve many problem types, including mixed binary and continuous variable types, bilevel optimization problems and constrained problems without altering the base algorithm.
parameter ensembles can be selected based upon simulation error, along with other criteria such as diversity or steady-state performance.
simulations using parameter ensembles can estimate confidence intervals on model variables, and robustly constrain model predictions, despite having many poorly constrained parameters.
we demonstrate jupoets on a suite of multiobjective problems, including test functions with parameter bounds and system constraints as well as for the identification of a proof-of-concept biochemical model with four conflicting training objectives.
jupoets identified optimal or near optimal solutions approximately six-fold faster than a corresponding implementation in octave for the suite of test functions.
in this software note, we present a multiobjective based technique to estimate parameter or models ensembles, the pareto optimal ensemble technique in the julia programming language .
jupoets is a promising approach for the estimation of parameter and model ensembles using multiobjective optimization.
