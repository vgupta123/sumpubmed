these results are consistent with a role for sry <dig> in increasing bp by directly or indirectly activating renal sympathetic nervous system activity.
we delivered  <dig> Î¼g of either the expression construct sry1/pcdna  <dig> , sry2/pcdna  <dig> , or control vector into the medulla of the left kidney of normotensive wky rats by electroporation.
weekly air stress was performed to determine bp responsiveness.
also the pressor response to air stress was significantly elevated in males electroporated with sry <dig>  compared to controls .
alpha adrenergic receptor blockade prevented the air stress pressor response in both strains.
the hormone profiles for plasma renin, aldosterone, and corticosterone between electroporated sry <dig> and control vector males showed no significant differences over the  <dig> day period.
pre-surgery baseline and weekly blood samples were taken from sry <dig> electroporated and control vector males for plasma renin, aldosterone, and corticosterone.
sry <dig> did not elevate bp or sns indices and further tests were not done.
a candidate for this y chromosome hypertension locus is sry, a gene that encodes a transcription factor responsible for testes determination.
our laboratory has shown that a locus on the shr y chromosome increases blood pressure  in the shr rat and in wky rats with the shr y chromosome .
separate groups of animals were tested for renal function and plasma hormone patterns and pharmacological intervention using alpha adrenergic receptor blockade.
the shr y chromosome has six divergent sry loci.
urinary dopamine significantly increased after  <dig> days post sry electroporation.
bp was measured by telemetry and tyrosine hydroxylase and catecholamines by hplc with electrochemical detection.
