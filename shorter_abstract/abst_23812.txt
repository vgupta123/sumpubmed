in viewing of these challenges, we propose a deep learning-based framework  by using a novel hybrid convolutional neural network and deep belief network to predict the rbp interaction sites and motifs on rnas.
the other difficulty is how to interpret the prediction results.
to validate our ideep method, we performed experiments on  <dig> large-scale clip-seq datasets, and our results show that by integrating multiple sources of data, the average auc can be improved by 8% compared to the best single-source-based predictor; and through cross-domain knowledge integration at an abstraction level, it outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors by 6%.
large-scale experiments demonstrate that these mined binding motifs agree well with the experimentally verified results, suggesting ideep is a promising approach in the real-world applications.
rnas play key roles in cells through the interactions with proteins known as the rna-binding proteins  and their binding motifs enable crucial understanding of the post-transcriptional regulation of rnas.

one of current difficulties is that the cross-source shared common knowledge is at a higher abstraction level beyond the observed data, resulting in a low efficiency of direct integration of observed data across domains.
the ideep framework not only can achieve promising performance than the state-of-the-art predictors, but also easily capture interpretable binding motifs.
