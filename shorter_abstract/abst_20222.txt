the ability of the pqs found in the upstream regions of group b var genes  to form stable g-quadruplex structures in vitro was confirmed using 1h nmr, circular dichroism, uv spectroscopy, and thermal denaturation experiments.
these results allow the generation of a novel hypothesis that the g-quadruplex sequences in the upstream regions of var genes have the potential to play a role in the transcriptional control of this major virulence-associated multi-gene family.
when found in gene promoter regions, g-quadruplexes can downregulate gene expression, possibly by blocking the transcriptional machinery.
we identified  <dig> pqs in the non-telomeric regions of the p. falciparum clone 3d <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> of these pqs occurred in the upstream region of a subset of the p. falciparum var genes .
moreover, the synthetic compound boq <dig> that shows a higher affinity for dna forming quadruplex rather than duplex structures was found to bind with high affinity to the upsb-q.
this is the first demonstration of non-telomeric pqs in the genome of p. falciparum that form stable g-quadruplexes under physiological conditions in vitro.
here we have used a genome-wide bioinformatic approach to identify putative g-quadruplex sequences  in the plasmodium falciparum genome, along with biophysical techniques to examine the physiological stability of p. falciparum pqs in vitro.
