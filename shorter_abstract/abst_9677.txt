aurora kinases and loss of p <dig> function are implicated in the carcinogenesis of aneuploid esophageal cancers.
further assessment of aurora kinases and p <dig> interactions in cells or tissue specimens derived from non-invasive dysplasia  or intestinal metaplasia  are necessary to disclose a potential causative role of aurora kinases and p <dig> for development of aneuploid, invasive esophageal cancers.
a control esophageal epithelial cell line  had normal aurora-a and -b gene copy numbers and expression, was p <dig> wild type and displayed bipolar mitoses.
here, we investigated the occurrence of multipolar mitoses, aurora-a/-b gene copy numbers and expression/activation as well as p <dig> alterations in aneuploid escc and bac cancer cell lines.
aurora-b gene copy numbers were not elevated in oe <dig> and oe <dig> cells despite chromosome  <dig> polysomy.
their association with occurrence of multipolar mitoses in the two main histotypes of aneuploid esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  and barrett's adenocarcinoma  remains unclear.
multipolar mitoses occurred with high frequency in oe <dig> , followed by oe <dig>  and kyse- <dig>  cells.
single multipolar mitoses occurred in oe <dig>  cells.
high aurora-a expression alone is not associated with overt multipolar mitoses in aneuploid escc and bac cancer cells, as specifically shown here for oe <dig> and oe <dig> cells, respectively.
aurora-a expression and activity  was not directly linked to gene copy numbers and was highest in kyse- <dig> and oe <dig> cells.
the mitotic index was highest in oe <dig>  followed by oe <dig> > oe <dig> > kyse- <dig> and epc-htert cells.
distinct p <dig> mutations and p <dig> protein expression patterns were found in all esophageal cancer cell lines, but complete functional p <dig> inactivation occurred in oe <dig> and oe <dig> only.
additional p <dig> loss of function mutations are necessary for this to occur, at least for invasive esophageal cancer cells.
