this aspect remains under-documented in the literature, as quantitative measures of data reliability are most often lacking.
this is especially important with extremely low quantities of input rna where stochastic effects due to template dilution may be present.
anova analysis was used to estimate the overall effects of reduced input rna in our experimental design.
from expression data, transcount provided estimates of absolute transcript concentrations in each examined sample.
the results from transcount were used to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between transcript concentrations for different sample sizes.
an important concern is the reliable reflection of the starting material in the results obtained.
these results imply that the reliability of any amplification experiment must be validated empirically to justify that any gene exists in sufficient quantity in the input material.
to address this issue, we examined the sensitivity levels of each transcript in  <dig> different cell sample sizes.
in order to estimate the validity of decreasing sample sizes, we examined the sensitivity levels of each transcript by applying a novel model-based method, transcount.
global mrna amplification has become a widely used approach to obtain gene expression profiles from limited material.
this finding has important implications for any experiment where only extremely small samples such as single cell analyses or laser captured microdissected cells are available.
a critical level was observed where stochastic fluctuations became significant.
