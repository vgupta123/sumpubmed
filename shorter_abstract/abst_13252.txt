the data indicate that the oep <dig> activity represents a single channel unit and does not assemble into a multiple pore complex like bacterial type porins or mitochondrial voltage dependent anion channel.
the reconstituted recombinant protein oep <dig> from pea forms a high conductance ion channel with a maximal conductance in the fully open state of 466 ± 14ps at a holding potential of +100 mv .
the oep <dig> channel is cation selective  with a voltage dependent open probability of maximal vmem = 0 mv.
metabolite, ion and protein translocation into chloroplasts occurs across two membranes, the inner and the outer envelope.
here we describe the identification and the characterization of the outer envelope protein of 23 kda, oep <dig> from garden pea.
thus, oep <dig> represents a new member of ion channels in the outer envelope of chloroplasts involved in solute exchange.
