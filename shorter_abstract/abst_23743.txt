however, in the biomedical community, there is yet no general consensus regarding named entity annotation; thus, the resources are largely incompatible, and it is difficult to compare the performance of systems developed on resources that were divergently annotated.
thus, it becomes a task of interest to integrate the heterogeneous annotations in these resources.
this degradation may be caused by the newly added heterogeneous annotations, and cannot be fixed without an understanding of the heterogeneities that exist among the corpora.
we find that the f-score performance declines tremendously when training with integrated data, instead of training with pure data; in some cases, the performance drops nearly 12%.
we explore the potential sources of incompatibility among gene and protein annotations that were made for three common corpora: genia, genetag and aimed.
our analyses indicate that incompatibilities in the gene/protein annotations exist mainly in the following four areas: the boundary annotation conventions, the scope of the entities of interest, the distribution of annotated entities, and the ratio of overlap between annotated entities.
to show the inconsistency in the corpora annotations, we first tackle the incompatibility problem caused by corpus integration, and we quantitatively measure the effect of this incompatibility on protein mention recognition.
