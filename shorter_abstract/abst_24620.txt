pilot studies undertaken previously on protein kinases and immunoglobulins have shown that clap yields clusters, which have high functional and domain architectural similarity.
but, in the case of multi-domain proteins, the alignment quality might be poor due to varied lengths of the proteins, domain shuffling or circular permutations.
due to the huge gap in the available protein sequence and structural space, tools that can generate functionally homogeneous clusters using only the sequence information, hold great importance.
moreover, parsing at a statistically determined cut-off resulted in clusters that corroborated with the sub-family level classification of that particular domain family.
multi-domain proteins are ubiquitous in nature, hence alignment-free tools, which overcome the shortcomings of alignment-based protein comparison methods, are required.

clap works on full-length sequences and does not require prior domain definitions.
further, existing tools classify proteins using only domain-level information and hence miss out on the information encoded in the tethered regions or accessory domains.
our web-server, clap , is one such alignment-free software for automatic classification of protein sequences.
our method can be used for any set of protein sequences, yielding functionally relevant clusters with high domain architectural homogeneity.
our method, on the other hand, takes into account the full-length sequence of a protein, consolidating the complete sequence information to understand a given protein better.
