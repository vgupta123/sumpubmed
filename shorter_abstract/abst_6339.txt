several standard statistical summary techniques can be used, but network methods also provide useful alternative methods to find representatives.
third, we study aggregating the information of cell type marker genes when the aim is to predict the abundance of cell types in a tissue sample based on gene expression data .
first, we study a crucial step of the meta-analysis of microarray data: the merging of independent gene expression data sets, which may have been measured on different platforms.
toward this end, we collapse multiple microarray probes for a single gene and then merge the data by gene identifier.
finally, to facilitate biological interpretation of collapsed gene lists, we introduce the function userlistenrichment, which assesses the enrichment of gene lists for known brain and blood cell type markers, and for other published biological pathways.
we apply different collapsing methods to predict cell type abundances in peripheral human blood and in mixtures of blood cell lines.
examples include summarizing several probe measurements corresponding to a single gene, representing the expression profiles of a co-expression module by a single expression profile, and aggregating cell-type marker information to de-convolute expression data.
second, we study methods for summarizing the gene expression profiles of a co-expression module.
