our results indicate that reproductive isolation, geographic and host plant barriers to gene flow are absent in c. siamense s. lat.
results of molecular analyses based on the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition  and coalescent methods  do not support the recognition of any independent evolutionary lineages within c. siamense s. lat.
this discovery emphasized the importance of a polyphasic approach when describing novel species in morphologically conserved genera of plant pathogenic fungi.
presently there are significant disagreements among mycologists as to what constitutes a species in c. siamense s.
it is however possible to mask the discordance between individual gene trees, thus the speciation events might be erroneously estimated if one simply recognizes well supported clades as distinct species without implementing a careful examination of species boundary.
this conclusion is reinforced by the recognition of genetic recombination, cross fertility, and the comparison of ecological and morphological characters.
concatenation analysis of multi-locus dna sequence data represents a powerful and commonly used approach to recognizing evolutionary independent lineages in fungi.
as distinct species, thus rejecting the null hypothesis.
accurate delimitation of plant pathogenic fungi is critical for the establishment of quarantine regulations, screening for genetic resistance to plant pathogens, and the study of ecosystem function.
in this study, multiple approaches were used to test the null hypothesis â€œc.
