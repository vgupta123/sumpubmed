correlations between norepinephrine, soluble sugars and starch concentration have been recently reported for potato plants over-expressing tyrosine decarboxylase, the enzyme mediating the first step of catecholamine synthesis.
since to date no catecholamine receptor has been identified in plants we transformed potato plants with a cdna encoding human dopamine receptor .
however the presence of the receptor affected a broader range of enzyme activities than those affected by the massive accumulation of norepinephrine reported for plants over-expressing tyrosine decarboxylase.
therefore, it is possible that catecholamines might play a role in plant stress responses by modulating primary carbon metabolism, possibly by a mechanism similar to that in animal cells.
tuber analysis of transgenic plants revealed changes in the activities of key enzymes mediating sucrose to starch conversion  and sucrose synthesis  leading to altered content of both soluble sugars and starch.
surprisingly the catecholamine level measured in transgenic plants was significantly increased; the reason for this is as yet unknown.
