use of rescue treatment decreased with treatment in the abt- <dig> and carprofen groups .
however, little is known about effect sizes of common outcome-measures in canine clinical trials evaluating treatment of oa pain.
questionnaire score and activity count at the end of treatment were correlated with age, clinical severity at trial entry, and outcome measure baseline status .
efficacy studies of analgesic drug treatment of dogs with naturally occurring oa may be challenging, as a caregiver placebo effect is typically evident.
treatment of hip oa in client-owned dogs is associated with a placebo effect for all variables that are commonly used for efficacy studies of analgesic drugs.
forty-nine client-owned dogs with hip oa were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled prospective trial.
in the present study, outcome measures with significant effects also varied between groups, highlighting the value of using multiple outcome measures, as well as an a priori analysis of effect size associated with each measure.
effect size data from the present study could be used to inform design of future trials studying analgesic treatment of canine oa.
our results suggest that analgesic treatment with abt- <dig> is not as effective as carprofen or tramadol for treatment of hip arthritis pain in client-owned dogs.
kinetic gait analysis did not reveal significant treatment effects.
nighttime activity was increased after abt- <dig> treatment .
outcome-measures included physical examination parameters, owner questionnaire, activity monitoring, gait analysis, and use of rescue medication.
acute hyperthermia developed after abt- <dig> treatment .
placebo treatment effects were evident with all variables studied.
