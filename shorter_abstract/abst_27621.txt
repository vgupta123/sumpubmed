we investigated the association between gender, gestational and postnatal age, preeclampsia , premature rupture of membranes  as well as prenatal steroid treatment  and the frequency of activated t lymphocyte subsets  and major t lymphocyte subpopulations  in peripheral blood during the first postnatal week in preterm infants.

inappropriate activation of t lymphocytes plays an important role in perinatal complications.
the frequency of cd25+ t lymphocytes was higher in prom.
the frequency of cd62l+ t lymphocytes was higher in male compared with female infants.
however, data on t lymphocyte activation markers of preterm infants is scarce.
cord blood and peripheral blood samples were collected from  <dig> preterm infants on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days of life.
our observations indicate that alterations affecting the expression of t lymphocyte activation markers are associated with the above factors and may play a role in the development of perinatal complications.
we assessed the frequency of the above t lymphocyte subsets using flow cytometry.
