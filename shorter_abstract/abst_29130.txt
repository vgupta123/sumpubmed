the lack of major qtls for gas exchange and stomatal traits under control and saline conditions indicates a complex relationship between salinity and leaf gas exchange due to the fact that these complex quantitative traits are under the control of multiple genes.
a total of  <dig> significant qtls  and  <dig> tentative qtls  were identified.
qtls for biomass, intercellular co <dig> concentration, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance under control conditions co-localised together.
a qtl for salinity tolerance also co-localised with qtls for grain yield and biomass on chromosome 3h.
a barley double haploid population with  <dig> lines derived from a cross between cm <dig>  and gairdner  was used to detect quantitative trait loci  associated with stomatal and photosynthetic traits related to salinity tolerance.
based on the draft barley genome, the candidate genes for salinity tolerance at this locus are proposed.
these qtls are distributed on all the seven chromosomes, except 5h and explain  <dig> – <dig> % of the phenotypic variation.
a linkage was found between stomatal pore area and gas exchange.

a qtl for biomass also co-located with one for transpiration rate under salinity stress.
