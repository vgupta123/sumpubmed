the method obtains results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while being more generic and flexible.
the actual computations are executed in a compact vector space, limited by the most informative extraction results.
apart from comparisons with reported results, some interesting features of the method have been studied, i.e.
experimental evaluation shows that the presented method obtains results that are comparable with current state of the art methods, even surpassing them on a majority of the benchmarks.
it is a legitimate alternative to the costly construction of specialized knowledge-rich resources.

computing semantic relatedness between textual labels representing biological and medical concepts is a crucial task in many automated knowledge extraction and processing applications relevant to the biomedical domain, specifically due to the huge amount of new findings being published each year.
in this paper we present a simple resource-efficient method for calculating semantic relatedness in a knowledge-poor environment.
the solution being presented here was designed to use only a relatively generic and small document corpus and its statistics, without referring to a previously defined knowledge base, thus it does not assume a 'closed' problem.
we propose a method in which computation for two input texts is based on the idea of comparing the vocabulary associated with the best-fit documents related to those texts.
