we conclude that administration of either apt or ahmp along with the major anti-leukemic drug 6mp might serve as a good combination cancer chemotherapy regimen.
the results suggest that the efficiency of substrate binding to xod and its subsequent catalytic hydroxylation is much superior for xanthine in comparison to 6mp.
we further undertook the toxicological evaluation of these inhibitors in a single dose acute toxicity study in mice and our preliminary experimental results suggested that the inhibitors were equally non-toxic in the tested doses.
this necessitates the use of a preferential xod inhibitor that selectively inhibits 6mp transformation, but leaves xanthine metabolism unaffected.
the anticancer drug, 6-mercaptopurine  is subjected to metabolic clearance through xanthine oxidase  mediated hydroxylation, producing 6-thiouric acid , which is excreted in urine.
co-administration of allopurinol, a suicide inhibitor of xod, which blocks the hydroxylation of 6mp inadvertently enhances the 6mp blood level, counters this reduction.
