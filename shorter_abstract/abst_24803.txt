our findings indicate that pam plays an important role in enhancing surface attachment in insect blood.
we investigated the secreted proteome of a clinical isolate of p. asymbiotica at different temperatures in order to identify proteins relevant to the infection of the two different hosts.
interestingly, surface plasmon resonance  binding studies revealed that the pam protein itself has adhesive properties.
the pam protein shows limited sequence similarity to the  <dig>  kda component of a binary toxin of bacillus thuringiensis.
the pam gene is present in all photorhabdus strains tested and shows a high level of conservation across the whole genus, suggesting it is both ancestral to the genus and probably important to the biology of the bacterium.
in bacterial colonies, pam is associated with an extracellular polysaccharide -like matrix, and modifies the ability of wild-type cells to attach to an artificial surface.
although pam is produced throughout insect infection, genetic knockout does not affect either insect virulence or the ability of p. luminescens to form a symbiotic association with its host nematode, heterorhabditis bacteriophora.
a comparison of the proteins secreted by a clinical isolate of p. asymbiotica at simulated insect  and human  temperatures led to the identification of a small and highly abundant protein, designated pam, that is only secreted at the lower temperature.
we studied a highly abundant protein, pam, which is secreted in a temperature-dependent manner in p. asymbiotica.
