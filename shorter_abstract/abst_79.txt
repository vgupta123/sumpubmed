in an attempt to better define the members of the regulon, we have applied a simple in vitro electrophoretic screen for dna fragments that are bound by the chvi response regulator protein.
only a few transcriptional regulation targets have been determined, and as a result there is limited understanding of the mechanisms that are controlled by the system.
several putative transcriptional targets were identified and three were further examined by reporter gene fusion experiments for transcriptional regulation.

our results suggest a role for chvi as both a direct activator and repressor of transcription.
the identities and functions of many of these genes suggest explanations for some aspects of the pleiotropic phenotype of exos and chvi mutants.
