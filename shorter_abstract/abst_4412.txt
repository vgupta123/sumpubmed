these transcriptional changes may indicate selection pressure or simply breed differences which may be driven by human selection.
from these animals,  <dig> muscle samples obtained at slaughter were analyzed using the porcine agilent 44 k v <dig> microarray.
this study on transcriptomic differentiation across western pig breeds highlighted a global picture: mainly signaling pathways were affected.
the pi3k pathway is known to be involved in the control of development of the skeletal muscle mass by affecting extracellular matrix - receptor interactions, regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways and some metabolic functions.
samples came from:  <dig> duroc,  <dig> landrace,  <dig> large white dam line,  <dig> large white sire line and  <dig> piétrain.
this result is consistent with the selection objective of increasing muscle mass.
the functional analysis highlighted that gene expression diversity is mainly linked to cellular signaling pathways such as the pi3k  pathway.
in this study, the gene expression diversity across five pig breeds has been explored in muscle.
