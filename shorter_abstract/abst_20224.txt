phylogenetic analysis using bayes approach provided support for inferring functional divergence among regulatory cysteine and serine proteases.
many not only show significant similarity to proteases in the conserved domain database but have conserved active sites and catalytic domains.
this comprehensive analysis not only complements the growing knowledge base of proteolytic enzymes, but also provides a platform from which to expand knowledge of cestode proteases and to explore their biochemistry and potential as intervention targets.
owing to the emerging drug resistance and the inability of current drugs to prevent re-infection, identification of novel vaccines and chemotherapeutic agents against taenia solium and related helminth pathogens is a public health priority.
kegg automatic annotation server  analysis indicated that ~60% of these proteases share strong sequence identities with proteins of the kegg database, which are involved in human disease, metabolic pathways, genetic information processes, cellular processes, environmental information processes and organismal systems.
the t. solium genome and the predicted proteome were reported recently, providing a wealth of information from which new interventional targets might be identified.
in order to characterize and classify the entire repertoire of protease-encoding genes of t. solium, which act fundamental biological roles in all life processes, we analyzed the predicted proteins of this cestode through a combination of bioinformatics tools.
numerous putative proteases were identified for the first time in t. solium, and important regulatory proteases have been predicted.

also, we identified signal peptides and transmembrane helices through comparative analysis with classes of important regulatory proteases.
