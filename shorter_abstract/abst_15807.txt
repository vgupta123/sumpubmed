a better understanding of molecular pathways involved in the azadirachtin synthesis in a. indica will pave ways for bulk production of environment friendly biopesticides.
the molecular phylogenetic analyses grouped a. indica together with citrus sinensis from the rutaceae family validating its conventional taxonomic classification.
the current report describes the draft genome and four transcriptomes of a. indica and attempts to contextualise the sequence information in terms of its molecular phylogeny, transcript expression and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways.
the a. indica genome is at-rich, bears few repetitive dna elements and comprises about  <dig>  genes.
this study on a. indica genome and transcriptomes will provide a model for characterization of metabolic pathways involved in synthesis of bioactive compounds, comparative evolutionary studies among various meliaceae family members and help annotate their genomes.
genome and transcriptome analyses in a. indica led to the identification of repeat elements, nucleotide composition and expression profiles of genes in various organs.
comparative transcript expression analysis showed either exclusive or enhanced expression of known genes involved in neem terpenoid biosynthesis pathways compared to other sequenced angiosperms.
a. indica is the first member of the family meliaceae to be sequenced using next generation sequencing approach.
