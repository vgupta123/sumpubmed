these results are consistent with diffuse, predominantly frontal thalamo-cortical dysfunction during sleep in osa, as more posterior brain regions appear to maintain some physiological spindle frequency modulation across the night.
compared to non-osa subjects, moderate osa patients had higher central and parietal slow spindle percentage  in all night sections studied, and higher frontal ssp in sections ii and iii.
since obstructive sleep apnea  is a known cause of brain dysfunction, the aim of this study was to investigate sleep spindle frequency distribution in osa.
displaying changes in an opposite direction to what is expected from the aging process itself, spindle frequency appears to be informative in osa even with small sample sizes, and to represent a sensitive electrophysiological marker of brain dysfunction in osa.
a matching pursuit procedure was used for automatic detection of fast  and slow  spindles obtained from 30min samples of nrem sleep stage  <dig> taken from initial, middle and final night thirds  of frontal, central and parietal scalp regions.
frontal slow spindle percentage in night section iii predicted osa with good accuracy, with osa likelihood increased by  <dig> %for every ssp unit increase .
as the night progressed, there was a reduction in central and parietal ssp, while frontal ssp remained high.
seven non-osa subjects and  <dig> patients with osa  were studied.
sleep spindles, as detected on scalp electroencephalography , are considered to be markers of thalamo-cortical network integrity.
