selection gradient analyses indicate that natural selection favored tadpoles with short, deep tail fins.
we studied predator-mediated selection on tadpoles of the wood frog, rana sylvatica, to identify this hypothesized period of differential predation risk and estimate its ontogenetic onset.
the probability of tadpole survival increased with increasing age and size, but declined steeply at the point in development where hind limbs began to erupt from the body wall.
transitions between life stages, however, may expose individuals to an increased risk of mortality, as the process of metamorphosis typically includes developmental stages that function relatively poorly in both the pre- and post-metamorphic habitat.
path models revealed that selection acted directly on tail morphology, rather than through its indirect influence on swimming performance.
this is consistent with the hypothesis that tail morphology influences predation rates by reducing the probability a predator strikes the head or body.
