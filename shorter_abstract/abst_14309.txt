transcriptome and proteome analysis resulted in the identification of the most abundant salivary gland-secreted proteins.
moreover, comparative analysis between the orthologues of these two different populations resulted in a high level of protein identity, including the predicted mhc class ii t-cell epitopes from all these salivary proteins.
salivary proteins from sandflies are potential targets for exploitation as vaccines to control leishmania infection; in this work we tested the hypothesis that salivary proteins from geographically distant phlebotomus duboscqi sandfly populations are highly divergent due to the pressure exerted by the host immune response.
orthologues of these salivary proteins were identified by phylogenetic tree analysis.
these data refute the hypothesis that salivary proteins from geographically distinct populations of the same phlebotomus sandfly species are highly divergent.
salivary gland cdna libraries were prepared from wild-caught p. duboscqi from mali and recently colonised flies of the same species from kenya.
