we transform the process of quality evaluation from simply viewing the segmentations, to obtaining p-values denoting significance of segmentation similarity.
we show how to evaluate and compare the quality of segmentations obtained by different techniques and alternative biological features.
there exist many segmentation techniques for genomic sequences, and the segmentations can also be based on many different biological features.
for some other segmentations, we show that equally good results are likely to appear by chance.
we apply randomization techniques for evaluating the quality of a given segmentation.
our example applications include isochore detection and the discovery of coding-noncoding structure.
