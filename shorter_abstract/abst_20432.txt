we identify a common set of challenges in managing provenance information across the pre-publication and post-publication phases of data in the translational research lifecycle.
the spf provides a unified framework to effectively manage provenance of translational research data during pre and post-publication phases.
traditional approaches to provenance management have focused on only partial sections of the translational research life cycle and they do not incorporate "domain semantics", which is essential to support domain-specific querying and analysis by scientists.
provenance representation - to support interoperability, reasoning, and incorporate domain semantics
a critical aspect of the nih translational research roadmap, which seeks to accelerate the delivery of "bench-side" discoveries to patient's "bedside," is the management of the provenance metadata that keeps track of the origin and history of data resources as they traverse the path from the bench to the bedside and back.
we define the semantic provenance framework , underpinned by the provenir upper-level provenance ontology, to address these challenges in the four stages of provenance metadata:
we apply the spf to two exemplar translational research projects, namely the semantic problem solving environment for trypanosoma cruzi  and the biomedical knowledge repository  project, to demonstrate its effectiveness.
a comprehensive provenance framework is essential for researchers to verify the quality of data, reproduce scientific results published in peer-reviewed literature, validate scientific process, and associate trust value with data and results.
provenance storage and propagation - to allow efficient storage and seamless propagation of provenance as the data is transferred across applications
this framework is underpinned by an upper-level provenance ontology called provenir that is extended to create domain-specific provenance ontologies to facilitate provenance interoperability, seamless propagation of provenance, automated querying, and analysis.
