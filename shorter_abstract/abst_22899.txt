through instantiating the proposed objective functions in the form of novel algorithms, practitioners can more accurately capture the known behavior of isotope traces, isotopic envelopes, and replicate lc-ms data, ultimately providing for improved quantitative accuracy.
by enumerating extant objective functions for these problems, we elucidate discrepancies between known lc-ms data behavior and extant approaches.
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is a popular technique for high-throughput protein, lipid, and metabolite comparative analysis.

we propose novel objective functions that more closely model known lc-ms behavior.
moreover, not all extant correspondence methods leverage the rich discriminating information offered by isotope envelope extraction informed by isotope trace extraction.
