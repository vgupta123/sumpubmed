the purpose of this work is to mathematically derive the biometric model for haploid loci, and to compute power for qtl mapping when the loci are haploid.
we have derived the biometric model for power calculations for haploid loci and have developed software to perform these calculations.
furthermore, failure to appropriately model haploid loci may cause underestimation of power.
statistical power calculations are a critical part of any study design for gene mapping.
our results fill a need in power calculations for qtl mapping studies.
however, there are common situations in human genetics such as x-linked loci in males where the locus is haploid.
