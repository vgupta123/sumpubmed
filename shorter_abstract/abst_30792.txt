we illustrate our procedure in legumes and grasses and exemplify its application in legumes, where model plant studies and the genome- and est-sequence data available have a potential impact on the breeding of crop species and on our understanding of the evolution of this large and diverse family.
taking advantage of sequence data from related species, the pipeline identifies evolutionarily conserved sequences that are likely to define unique orthologous loci in most species of the same phylogenetic clade.
to identify potential anchor marker sequences more efficiently, we have established an automated bioinformatic pipeline that combines multi-species expressed sequence tags  and genome sequence data.
based on this database, we have evaluated  <dig> candidate anchor loci with respect to marker development in legume species with no sequence information available, demonstrating the validity of this approach.
polymorphisms can subsequently be identified by size- or sequence variation of pcr products, amplified from mapping parents or populations.
complete or near-complete genomic sequence information is presently only available for a few plant species representing a large phylogenetic diversity among plants.
in order to effectively transfer this information to species lacking sequence information, comparative genomic tools need to be developed.
