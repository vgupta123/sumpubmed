the data also support a key function of the conversion of glycerate to 2- or 3-phosphoglycerate via glycerate kinase in funneling various substrates into the common emp pathway for catabolic and anabolic purposes.
however, so far no enzymatic information of the non-phosphorylative ed branch and especially its key enzyme – glycerate kinase – was available.
in the t. tenax genome, a gene homolog with similarity to putative hydroxypyruvate reductase/glycerate dehydrogenase and glycerate kinase was identified.
the encoding gene was expressed in e. coli in a recombinant form, the gene product purified and the glycerate kinase activity was confirmed by enzymatic studies.
data bank searches revealed that archaeal glycerate kinases are members of the mofrl  family, and homologs are found in all three domains of life.
detailed analyses including phylogenetic studies demonstrate the presence of three distinct glycerate kinase classes in extant organisms that share no common origin.
the affiliation of characterized glycerate kinases with the different enzyme classes as well as their physiological/cellular function reveals no association with particular pathways but a separate phylogenetic distribution.
a re-evaluation of available genome sequence information as well as biochemical and phylogenetic studies revealed the presence of the branched ed pathway as common route for sugar degradation in archaea that utilize the ed pathway.
the enzyme was active as a monomer and catalyzed the atp-dependent phosphorylation of d-glycerate forming exclusively 2-phosphoglycerate.
this work highlights the diversity and complexity of the central carbohydrate metabolism.
the enzyme showed high affinity for d-glycerate  as well as atp , although at higher glycerate concentrations, substrate inhibition was observed.
