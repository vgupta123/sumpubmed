it is generally agreed that horizontal gene transfer  is common in phagotrophic protists.
however, the overall scale of hgt and the cumulative impact of acquired genes on the evolution of these organisms remain largely unknown.
our results suggest that hgt is frequent in monosiga brevicollis and might have contributed substantially to its adaptation and evolution.
many of the horizontally acquired genes identified in monosiga were probably acquired from food sources, rather than by endosymbiotic gene transfer  from obsolete endosymbionts or plastids.
in this study, we performed phylogenomic analyses to investigate the scale of hgt and the evolutionary importance of horizontally acquired genes in the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis.
of  <dig> genes identified in our analyses with functional information,  <dig>  are involved in carbohydrate or amino acid metabolism, and  <dig>  are transporters and/or involved in response to oxidative, osmotic, antibiotic, or heavy metal stresses.
some identified genes may also participate in biosynthesis of important metabolites such as vitamins c and k <dig>  porphyrins and phospholipids.
