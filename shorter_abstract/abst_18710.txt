in a simulation study, the strategy that uses all building blocks is able to detect true main effects and interactions with high sensitivity in different kinds of scenarios.
we determined the limits of interaction detection in terms of necessary effect sizes.
in this feasibility study, we present building blocks for evaluating and incorporating interactions terms in high-dimensional time-to-event settings, especially for settings in which it is computationally too expensive to check all possible interactions.
we use a boosting technique for estimation of effects and the following building blocks for pre-selecting interactions:  resampling,  random forests and  orthogonalization as a data pre-processing step.
the other building blocks also contribute considerably to an enhanced pre-selection of interactions.
for multivariate risk prediction models on such high-dimensional data, there are established techniques that combine parameter estimation and variable selection.
results on real world data illustrate that effect sizes of interactions frequently may not be large enough to improve prediction performance, even though the interactions are potentially of biological relevance.
our study emphasizes the importance of making full use of existing methods in addition to establishing new ones.
screening interactions through random forests is feasible and useful, when one is interested in finding relevant two-way interactions.
