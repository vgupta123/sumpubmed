differences are highlighted, not interpreted, allowing the investigator to make the ultimate decision on the nature of the change.
this paper describes seqdoc, a simple, web-based tool to carry out direct comparison of abi sequence chromatograms.
homozygous and heterozygous substitutions and insertion/deletion events are all readily identified.
seqdoc produces a subtracted trace showing differences between a reference and test chromatogram, and is optimised to emphasise those characteristic of single base changes.
the use of direct comparison of the sequence chromatograms means that artefacts introduced by automatic base-calling software are avoided.
this allows the rapid identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and point mutations without the need to install or learn more complicated analysis software.
