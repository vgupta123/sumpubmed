the primary, non-transformed epithelial cells, the focus of this study, were characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and in vitro cell culture.
normal, healthy human breast tissue from a variety of volunteer donors has become available for research thanks to the establishment of the susan g. komen for the cure® tissue bank at the iu simon cancer center .
multiple epithelial  and stromal cells  were established from the donated tissue.
selective media and trypsinization were employed to select either epithelial cells or stromal cells.
all of the primary, non-transformed epithelial cells tested have the ability to differentiate in vitro into a variety of cell types when plated in or on biologic matrices.
the plasticity of the epithelial cells developed mimics that seen in metaplastic carcinoma of the breast , a subtype of triple negative breast cancer; and may provide clues to the origin of this particularly aggressive type of breast cancer.
the ktb is a unique biorepository, and the normal breast epithelial cells isolated from donated tissue have significant potential as new research tools.
explant culture was utilized to isolate the cells from pieces of breast tissue.
the cells also express markers of embryonic stem cells.
