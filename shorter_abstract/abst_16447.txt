the new basecalling method described here, named multipass, implements a probabilistic framework for working with the raw flowgrams obtained by pyrosequencing.
we apply the method to  <dig> amplicon pyrosequencing data obtained from a malaria virulence gene family, where multipass generates 20Â % more error-free sequences than current state of the art methods, and provides sequence characteristics that allow generation of a set of high confidence error-free sequences.
for each sequence variant multipass calculates the likelihood and nucleotide sequence of several most likely sequences given the flowgram data.
amplicon pyrosequencing targets a known genetic region and thus inherently produces reads highly anticipated to have certain features, such as conserved nucleotide sequence, and in the case of protein coding dna, an open reading frame.
pyrosequencing errors, consisting mainly of nucleotide insertions and deletions, are on the other hand likely to disrupt open reading frames.
this probabilistic approach enables integration of basecalling into a larger model where other parameters can be incorporated, such as the likelihood for observing a full-length open reading frame at the targeted region.
the inference of nucleotide sequence from raw sequencing data.
