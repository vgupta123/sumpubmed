we show that the three regulatory irg proteins , including irgm <dig>  each of which localizes to distinct sets of endocellular membranes, play an important role during the cellular response to ifn-γ, each protecting specific membranes from off-target activation of effector irg proteins .
the membrane targeting properties of the three gms proteins to specific endocellular membranes prevent accumulation of activated gks protein effectors on the corresponding membranes and thus enable gks proteins to distinguish organellar cellular membranes from the membranes of pathogen vacuoles.
another gms protein, irgm <dig>  is localized to endoplasmic reticulum  membranes; in the irgm3-deficient mouse, activated gks proteins are found at the er.
in the absence of irgm <dig>  which is localized mainly at lysosomal and golgi membranes, activated gks proteins load onto lysosomes, and are associated with reduced lysosomal acidity and failure to process autophagosomes.
our data suggest that the generalized lymphomyeloid collapse that occurs in irgm1−/− mice upon infection with a variety of pathogens may be due to lysosomal damage caused by off-target activation of gks proteins on lysosomal membranes and consequent failure of autophagosomal processing.
the irgm3-deficient mouse does not show the drastic phenotype of the irgm <dig> mouse.
in the irgm1/irgm <dig> double knock-out mouse, activated gks proteins associate with lipid droplets, but not with lysosomes, and the irgm1/irgm3−/− does not have the generalized immunodeficiency phenotype expected from its irgm <dig> deficiency.
however, the loss of irgm <dig> in mice also causes a dramatic but unexplained susceptibility phenotype upon infection with a variety of pathogens, including many not normally controlled by the irg system.
