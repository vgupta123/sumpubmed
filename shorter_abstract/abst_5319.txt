the first of these uses published ranging distances of parents as a measure of the natal home range, with the requirement that juveniles must exceed it for a minimum of 10 days .
the second method uses the biggest difference in the proportion of locations inside and outside of the natal home range smoothed over a 30 day period to assign the point of emigration.
we used tracking data from  <dig> golden eagles, fitted with long-lived gps satellite transmitters as nestlings, which we followed during their first year.
considerable individual variation in recorded behaviour appears to account for the difficulty capturing the point of emigration and these results demonstrate the potential pitfalls associated with species exhibiting complex dispersal behaviour.
previously published methods provided very different estimates of the point of emigration with a general tendency for most to apparently assign it prematurely.
by contrast the two methods we proposed provided very similar estimates for the point of emigration that under visual examination appeared to fit the definition of emigration much better.
despite one method requiring much more information, both methods provided robust estimates for when individuals emigrated at the start of natal dispersal.
we have used simple methods to decide when an individual has dispersed - they are rigorous and repeatable.
we propose and evaluate two new methods.
we anticipate that coupled with the rapidly increasing availability of tracking data, our new methods will, for at least some species, provide a far simpler and more biologically representative approach to determine the timing of emigration.
