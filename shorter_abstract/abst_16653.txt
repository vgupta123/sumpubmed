p. phoenicium’ strain populations in lebanon suggested that almwb disease could be associated with phytoplasma strains derived from the adaptation of an original strain to diverse hosts.
p. phoenicium’ strain sa <dig>  representative of phytoplasma strain populations from different host plants, and determined the genetic diversity among phytoplasma strain populations by phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna, groel, tufb and inmp gene sequences.
moreover, dn/ds analysis indicated positive selection acting on inmp gene.
sequence-based typing and phylogenetic analysis of the gene inmp, coding an integral membrane protein, distinguished almwb-associated phytoplasma strains originating from diverse host plants, whereas their 16s rrna, tufb and groel genes shared  <dig> % sequence identity.
one of the integral membrane proteins was predicted as bi- <dig>  an inhibitor of apoptosis-promoting bax factor.
moreover, the identification of a putative inhibitor of apoptosis-promoting bax factor  in ‘ca.
p. phoenicium’ draft genome revealed the presence of integral membrane proteins and effector-like proteins and potential candidates for interaction with hosts.
phytoplasma’ species suggested its potential role as a phytoplasma fitness-increasing factor by modification of the host-defense response.
