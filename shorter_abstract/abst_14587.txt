we have used array comparative genomic hybridization  to detect copy number variation in the genomes of  <dig> natural isolates of caenorhabditis elegans.
copy number variation is an important component of genetic variation in higher eukaryotes.
the extent of natural copy number variation in c. elegans is unknown outside of  <dig> highly divergent wild isolates and the canonical n <dig> bristol strain.
copy number variation is extensive in c. elegans, affecting over 5% of the genes in the genome.
the relationships between strains are complex and different regions of the genome possess different genealogies due to recombination throughout the natural history of the species, which may not be apparent in studies utilizing smaller numbers of genetic markers.
the deletions we have detected in natural isolates of c. elegans contribute significantly to the number of deletion alleles available to researchers.
deletions relative to the canonical n <dig> strain are more common in these isolates than duplications, and indels are enriched in multigene families on the autosome arms.
overall we detected  <dig> different deletions affecting  <dig> genes, or over 5% of the genes in the canonical n <dig> genome.
