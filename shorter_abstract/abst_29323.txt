it is suggested that helicases play essential roles in stabilizing growth in plants under stress because their presence in the stress-induced orfs has been identified.
moreover in a recent study we have reported that suv <dig> helicase from oryza sativa  functions in salinity stress tolerance in transgenic rice by improving the antioxidant machinery.
this study is the first direct evidence to show the bipolar dna helicase activity of ossuv <dig> protein.
it also contains the characteristic dna and rna helicase activity.
the km values of ossuv <dig> are  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm for dna helicase and rna helicase, respectively.

these results should make significant contribution towards better understanding of suv <dig> protein in plants.
the unique properties of ossuv <dig> including its dual helicase activity imply that it could be a multifunctional protein involved in biologically significant process of dna and rna metabolisms.
in this study, the purification and extensive characterization of recombinant ossuv <dig> protein  is presented.
helicases play crucial role in almost all the nucleic acid metabolism including replication, repair, recombination, transcription, translation, ribosome biogenesis and splicing and these processes regulate plant growth and development.
