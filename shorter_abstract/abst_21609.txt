y <dig> and l <dig> were predicated to possess the most important role in peptide binding.
analysis of the functional importance of side-chains by mutational study may exaggerate the effect by imposing a structural disturbance or an unusual steric, electrostatic or hydrophobic interaction.
the t cell epitopes of the sars cov spike protein are well known, but no systematic evaluation of the functional and structural roles of each residue has been reported for these antigenic epitopes.
moreover, s366- <dig> was predicted to be an optimal epitope by bioinformatics tools: ann, smm, arb and bimas, and confirmed by ifn-gamma response induced by a series of s358-374-derived peptides.
we demonstrated that s366- <dig> is an optimal h- <dig> kd ctl epitope in the sars cov s protein.
moreover, y <dig>  s <dig>  and l <dig> are anchors in the epitope, while c <dig>  g <dig>  v <dig>  a <dig>  t <dig>  and k <dig> may directly interact with tcr on the surface of cd8-t cells.
severe acute respiratory syndrome  is an emerging infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov.
furthermore, each of s366- <dig> was replaced by alanine , lysine  or aspartic acid , respectively.
