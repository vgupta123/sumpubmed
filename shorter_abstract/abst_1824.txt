during each release cycle approximately two weeks are allocated to generate all the genomic alignments and the protein homology predictions.
we present ehive, a new fault tolerant distributed processing system initially designed to support comparative genomic analysis, based on blackboard systems, network distributed autonomous agents, dataflow graphs and block-branch diagrams.
the ensembl project produces updates to its comparative genomics resources with each of its several releases per year.
in the ehive system a mysql database serves as the central blackboard and the autonomous agent, a perl script, queries the system and runs jobs as required.
ehive allows us to produce computationally demanding results in a reliable and efficient way with minimal supervision and high throughput.
we describe the implementation of three pipelines:  pairwise whole genome alignments,  multiple whole genome alignments and  gene trees with protein homology inference.
