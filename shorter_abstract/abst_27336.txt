after genorm analysis, actb and ppia were shown to be the most stably expressed in the pulmonary artery and actb and pgk <dig> in the lung tissue of bsd sheep.
this study demonstrates tissue associated variability in the selection of these normalisation genes in bsd sheep and underlines the importance of selecting the correct reference genes for both the animal model and tissue studied.
in australia and new zealand, less than 50% of lungs offered for donation post bsd are suitable for transplantation, as compared with over 90% of kidneys, resulting in patients dying for lack of suitable lungs.
little information however, is available on the expression stability of reference genes in the sheep pulmonary artery and lung.
real-time pcr is a highly sensitive method involving multiple steps from extraction to processing rna so the choice of housekeeping genes is important in obtaining reliable results.
accurate normalisation is critical in obtaining reliable and reproducible results in gene expression studies.
we aimed to establish a set of stably expressed reference genes for use as a standard for analysis of gene expression changes in bsd.
we evaluated the expression stability of  <dig> candidate normalisation genes  using real time quantitative pcr.
there was a wide range of ct-values within each tissue for pulmonary artery  and lung  but the expression pattern for each gene was similar across the two tissues.
heart and lung transplantation is frequently the only therapeutic option for patients with end stage cardio respiratory disease.
characterisation of the gene expression changes associated with bsd is critical and will assist in determining the aetiology of lung damage post bsd.
