while nhej has been thoroughly investigated in lymphocytes, the importance of nhej in other cell types, especially with regard to tumor suppression, is less well documented.
thus, our data reveal surprising new roles for artemis and the nhej pathway in normal msc function and fitness relevant to tumor suppression in mesenchymal tissues.
gene expression analysis revealed abnormally regulated stress response, cell proliferation, and signal transduction pathways in artemis-defective mscs.
we previously reported evidence that the nhej pathway functions to suppress a range of nonlymphoid tumor types, including various classes of sarcomas, by unknown mechanisms.
unrepaired dna double-stranded breaks  cause chromosomal rearrangements, loss of genetic information, neoplastic transformation or cell death.
in lymphocytes, nhej is critical for both development and genome stability.
in this context, we found that artemis deficiency led to chromosomal damage but, paradoxically, enhanced resistance and proliferative potential in primary mscs subjected to various stresses.
we propose that deficiency leads to a preneoplastic state in primary mscs and is associated with aberrant proliferative control and cellular stress resistance.
the nonhomologous end joining  pathway, catalyzing sequence-independent direct rejoining of dsbs, is a crucial mechanism for repairing both stochastically occurring and developmentally programmed dsbs.
