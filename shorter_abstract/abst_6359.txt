using xhm with its user-adjustable parameters will enable scientists to check their lists of differentially expressed genes from microarray experiments for potential cross-hybridizations.
we have developed a tool called xhm  for assessment of the reliability of hybridization signals by detecting potential cross-hybridizations on dna microarrays.
cross-hybridization among genes with high sequence similarities can be a source of error reducing the reliability of dna microarray results.
this provides information that may be useful in the validation of the microarray results.
microarrays have emerged as the preferred platform for high throughput gene expression analysis.
