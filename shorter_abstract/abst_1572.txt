this is a simple yet effective splice site detection method, which shows a better classification accuracy and computational speed than some other more complex methods.
the proposed method for splice site detection consists of two stages: a first order markov model  is used in the first stage and a support vector machine  with polynomial kernel is used in the second stage.
a higher-order markov model is generally regarded as a useful technique for modeling higher-order dependencies.
accurate identification of splice sites in dna sequences plays one of the central roles of gene structural prediction in eukaryotes.
the mm <dig> serves as a pre-processing step for the svm and takes dna sequences as its input.
recent advances and automation in dna sequencing technology has created a vast amount of dna sequence data.
when the proposed mm1-svm model is compared with other existing standard splice site detection methods, it shows a superior performance in all the cases.

however, their implementation requires estimating a large number of parameters, which is computationally expensive.
it models the compositional features and dependencies of nucleotides in terms of probabilistic parameters around splice site regions.
the probabilistic parameters are then fed into the svm, which combines them nonlinearly to predict splice sites.
effective detection of splice sites requires the knowledge of characteristics, dependencies, and relationship of nucleotides in the splice site surrounding region.
we proposed an effective pre-processing scheme for the svm and applied it for the identification of splice sites.
