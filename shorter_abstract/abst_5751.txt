furthermore, boris associates with mrna in both neural stem cells and young neurons.
in the nucleus, boris is particularly enriched in the nucleolus, a crucial compartment for ribosomal rna and rna metabolism.
however, little is known about cytoplasmic boris, which represents the major pool of boris protein.
boris , a paralogue of the multifunctional and ubiquitously expressed transcription factor ctcf, is best known for its role in transcriptional regulation.
we suggest that boris is involved in gene expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
the majority of the boris-associated transcripts are different in the two cell types.
