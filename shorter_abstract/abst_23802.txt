here we focus on the representation of connectomes by using graph theory formalisms.
such process requires modeling of the brain using graph theory and the subsequent comparison of the structure of graphs.

the results confirm that na algorithms may be applied in cases of atlas-free parcellation for a fully network-driven comparison of connectomes.
we compare the performances of algorithms by assessing six topological measures.
in this work, we first define the problem formally, then we test six existing state of the art of network aligners on diffusion mri-derived brain networks.
the atlas-based parcellations present some known limitations in cases of early brain development and abnormal anatomy.
the paper presented a new analysis methodology that uses network alignment for validating atlas-free parcellation brain connectomes.
