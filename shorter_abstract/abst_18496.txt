two identical gly-trna genes in tandem are present at the proximal end of this genetic element.
a close relatedness of this tra unit to f-like tra operons involved in conjugative transfer is confirmed by phylogenetic analyses performed on concatenated genes and gene order conservation.
this is the first hint of a putative conjugative system in chlamydiae.
this sequence is part of a 100-kb chromosome region, containing  <dig> highly co-oriented orfs, flanked by two 17-bp direct repeats.
a gi of the uwe <dig> chromosome encodes a potentially functional f-like dna conjugative system.
such a conjugative system might be involved in dna transfer between internalized bacteria.
in future, conjugative systems might be developed as genetic tools for chlamydiales.
since this system is absent from the sequenced genomes of chlamydiaceae, we hypothesize that it was acquired after the divergence between parachlamydiaceae and chlamydiaceae, when the parachlamydia-related symbiont was an intracellular bacteria.
surprisingly, one of them encodes all genes essential for f-like conjugative dna transfer , involved in sex pilus retraction and mating pair stabilization, strongly suggesting that, similarly to the other f-like operons, the parachlamydial tra unit is devoted to dna transfer.
conjugation most probably occurs within free-living amoebae, that may contain hundreds of parachlamydia bacteria tightly packed in vacuoles.
several mobility genes encoding transposases and bacteriophage-related proteins are located within this chromosome region.
these analyses and that of gly-trna distribution in  <dig> gis suggest a proteobacterial origin of the parachlamydial tra unit.
it suggests that this heterologous dna was acquired from a phylogenetically-distant bacteria sharing an amoebal vacuole.
