recently, several studies described notch-independent activities of the csl proteins.
we have analyzed their sequence conservation and identified the presence of well-defined domains typical of genuine csl proteins.
the phylogenetic analysis of the newly identified fungal csl proteins revealed the existence of two distinct classes, both of which are present in all the species studied.
furthermore, we have shown that the candidate fungal protein sequences contain highly conserved regions known to be required for sequence-specific dna binding in their metazoan counterparts.
we hypothesize that the ancestral csl function involved dna binding and notch-independent regulation of transcription and that this function may still be shared, to a certain degree, by the present csl family members from both fungi and metazoans.
our findings support the evolutionary origin of the csl transcription factor family in the last common ancestor of fungi and metazoans.
we have identified putative csl genes in several fungal species, showing that this family is not confined to metazoans.
the csl  transcription factor family members are well-known components of the transmembrane receptor notch signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in metazoan development.
