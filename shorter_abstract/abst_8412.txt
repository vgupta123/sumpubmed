anthocyanidins are synthesized by the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway with multi-layered regulatory control.
in this work we combined and optimized different protocols to enable the analysis of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway with as little as possible biological material.
we demonstrate that one col- <dig> seed/seedling is sufficient to obtain a fingerprint of the core substances of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.
moreover the combination of extracted non-hydrolysed, extracted hydrolysed and non-extracted hydrolysed samples proved useful to deduce the class of derivative from which the individual flavonoids have been released.
furthermore, our results suggest that cop <dig> is a master regulator of flavonoid biosynthesis in seedlings but not of flavonoid deposition in seeds.
we used a simplified sample preparation, two deuterated internal standards, a short and efficient lc separation, highly sensitive detection with tandem ms in multiple reaction monitoring  mode and hydrolytic release of the core substances to reduce complexity.
we chose core substances of this metabolic pathway that serve as a fingerprint to recognize alterations in the main branches of the pathway.
methods for the analysis of the flavonoid composition in plants are well established for different purposes.
when sample numbers are high and the plant material is limited, this method effectively facilitates metabolic fingerprinting with one seed, revealing shifts and differences in the pathway.
