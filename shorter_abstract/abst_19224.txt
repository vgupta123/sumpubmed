the analysis revealed the prevalent spread, during this epidemic, of a single anthrax clone.
a 25-loci multiple locus vntr analysis  mlva was initially performed to define genetic relationships, followed by an investigation of genetic diversity between epidemic strains through single nucleotide repeat  analysis.
sgt- <dig> - widely distributed across the epidemic area and present throughout the period in question - may, thus, be the ancestral form.
this study is a retrospective molecular epidemiological investigation carried out on  <dig> isolates collected during the epidemic.
during the summer of  <dig>  in the pollino national park, basilicata, southern italy, an anthrax epidemic consisting of  <dig> outbreaks occurred; it claimed the lives of  <dig> animals belonging to different mammal species.
the 25-loci mlva analysis identified all of them as belonging to a single genotype, while the snr analysis was able to detect the existence of five subgenotypes , allowing a detailed epidemic investigation.
these data confirm the importance of molecular typing and subtyping methods for in-depth epidemiological analyses of anthrax epidemics.
