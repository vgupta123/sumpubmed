there is a dramatic recrudescence of saprolegnia infections in aquaculture since the use of the toxic organic dye malachite green was banned in  <dig>  little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenicity in s. parasitica and other animal pathogenic oomycetes.
these resources will greatly accelerate research on this important pathogen.
about half of the unigenes showed similarities to known protein sequences or motifs.
several s. parasitica cdnas, such as those with similarity to fungal type i cellulose binding domain proteins, pan/apple module proteins, glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, as well as serine and cysteine protease inhibitors, were predicted to encode secreted proteins that could function in virulence.
based on the sequence alignments of  <dig> conserved proteins, the average amino acid identity between s. parasitica and three phytophthora species was 77% compared to 93% within phytophthora.
some of these cdnas were more similar to fungal proteins than to other eukaryotic proteins confirming that oomycetes and fungi share some virulence components despite their evolutionary distance
in this study we used a genomics approach to gain a first insight into the transcriptome of s. parasitica.
we generated  <dig> expressed sequence tags  from a mycelial cdna library of s. parasitica.
the s. parasitica sequences tended to be relatively divergent from phytophthora sequences.
we provide a first glimpse into the gene content of s. parasitica, a reemerging oomycete fish pathogen.
the oomycete saprolegnia parasitica is one of the most economically important fish pathogens.
