we have developed point-and-click software for non-parametric population structure analysis distributed as an r package.
therefore, it is imperative to have software that makes full use of these genetic data to generate inference even when model assumptions do not hold or allele frequency estimation suffers from high variation.
moreover, this software can also infer the optimal number of populations.
the software takes advantage of the large number of snps available to categorize individuals into ethnically similar clusters and it does not require assumptions about population models.
our software tool employs non-parametric approaches to assign individuals to clusters using snps.
structure and l-pop, usually assume hardy-weinberg equilibrium  and linkage equilibrium among loci in sample population individuals.
population structure analysis is important to genetic association studies and evolutionary investigations.
it can be complementary to parametric approaches in population structure analysis.
the improved version of structure  can incorporate linkage information among loci but is still sensitive to high background linkage disequilibrium.
however, the assumptions may not hold and allele frequency estimation may not be accurate in some data sets.
