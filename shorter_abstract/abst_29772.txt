another viral protein encoded by htlv-i, p <dig>  has been shown to affect virus replication at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.
in addition, these alterations in gene expression may play a role in cell transformation and the onset of leukemia.
our study identifies for the first time the cellular genes for which nuclear export is affected by p <dig>  these results suggest that p <dig> may possess a more global function with respect to mrna transcription and the nuclear shuttling of cellular mrna transcripts.
using microarray analysis, we analyzed total and cytoplasmic cellular mrna transcript levels isolated from pbmcs to assess the effect of p <dig> on cellular rna transcript expression and their nuclear export.
we further tested nuclear export of cellular mrna and found that p <dig> expression also resulted in a  <dig>  fold post-transcriptional down-regulation of  <dig> genes and the up-regulation of  <dig> genes.
overall, our study describes that expression of the htlv-i protein p <dig> both positively and negatively alters the expression of cellular transcripts.
identification of these rna may reveal new targets and increase our understanding of htlv-i pathogenesis.
these pleiotropic effects of tax modify the expression of a wide array of cellular genes.
in this study, using primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we report a genome wide analysis of human genes transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by the htlv-i protein p <dig>
human t-cell leukemia virus type  <dig>  is a human retrovirus that is etiologically linked to adult t-cell leukemia , an aggressive and fatal lymphoproliferative disease.
