these included achatin, allototropin, conopressin, elevenin, fmrfamide, lfrfamide, lrfnvamide, myomodulins, neurokinin y, pkymdt, pxfvamide, scapamides and several insulin-like peptides.
several land snail species, including theba pisana, are crop pests of major concern, causing extensive damage to agriculture and horticulture.

our results provide the most comprehensive picture of the molecular genes and proteins associated with land snail functioning, including the repertoire of neuropeptides that likely play significant roles in neuroendocrine signalling.
further investigation of the cns transcriptome demonstrated that it might contain as many as  <dig>  genes that encode for proteins destined for extracellular secretion.
a total of  <dig> full-length neuropeptide genes were abundantly expressed within t. pisana cns, encoding precursors that release molluscan-type bioactive neuropeptide products.
a deeper understanding of their molecular biology is necessary in order to develop methods to manipulate land snail populations.
this information has the potential to expedite the study of molluscan metabolism and potentially stimulate advances in the biological control of land snail pest species.
