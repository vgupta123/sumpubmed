we show that it is possible to selectively amplify and clone expressed tr v genes in one single rt-pcr step and from as little as  <dig> cells.
here, we present a list of primers computationally designed on all functional tr v and j genes listed in the imgt®, the immunogenetics information system®.
amplification and cloning of naïve t cell receptor  repertoires or antigen-specific tr is crucial to shape immune response and to develop immuno-based therapies.
the list consists of unambiguous or degenerate primers suitable to theoretically amplify and clone the entire tr repertoire.
the cloning of expressed genes as large diverse libraries from natural sources relies upon the availability of primers able to amplify as many v genes as possible.
