red algae are primitive photosynthetic eukaryotes, whose spores are ideal subjects for studies of photosynthesis and development.
in the disk, the psii activity of both marginal and central cells was similar, although some degree of morphological polarity was present; the psii photosynthetic capabilities in young germling exhibited an apico-basal gradient.
the results indicated that freshly released tetraspores retained limited psii photosynthetic capabilities; when the tetraspores attached to a substrate, those capabilities increased significantly.
attachment of tetraspores to a substrate significantly enhanced their psii photosynthetic capabilities, and triggered further development.
within the young germling, the hetero-distribution of psii photosynthetic capabilities might be due to the differences in cell functions.
the central protrusion of the disk is the growth point, may have transfer of nutritive material with the marginal cells.
herein, we documented these changes in this species of red algae.
scanning electron microscopy observations and analysis of histological sections revealed that the natural shape of the disk remains tapered over time, and the erect frond grows from the central protrusion of the disk.
cultivation of tissue from excised disks demonstrated that the central protrusion of the disk is essential for initiation of the erect frond.
although the development of red alga spores has received considerable research attention, few studies have focused on the detailed morphological and photosynthetic changes that occur during the early development of tetraspores of gracilaria vermiculophylla  papenfuss .
