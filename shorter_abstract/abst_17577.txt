we found that some allergen orthologue classes that had predicted structural congruence to allergens and allergen epitopes were ubiquitous in all fungi.
a final group of allergen orthologues, including the major allergens asp f  <dig> and alt a  <dig>  appear to be present in only a limited number of species.
the fungal kingdom contains a number of species that produce a wide range of well defined protein allergens although the vast majority of fungal species have unknown allergenic potential.
these results imply that most fungi may possess proteins that have potential to be allergens or to cross react with allergens.
the recent genome sequencing of a variety of fungi provides the opportunity to assess the occurrence of allergen orthologues across the fungal kingdom.
here we use comparative genomics to survey the occurrence of allergen orthologues in fungi.
other allergen orthologues classes were less well conserved and may not possess conserved allergen epitope orthologues in all fungi.
this, together with the observation that important allergens such as asp f  <dig> are limited to genera or species, has significant implications for understating fungal sensitization, and interpreting diagnosis and management of fungal allergy.
