in this study, the masal gene has been evaluated for its in planta antifungal activity in rice plants.
molecular analyses of transgenic plants confirmed the presence and stable integration of masal gene.
the present study opens up the possibility of engineering rice plants with the antifungal gene masal, conferring resistance to sheath blight.
a mutant variant of mannose binding allium sativum leaf agglutinin  was previously reported to exhibit strong antifungal activity against r. solani.
in planta bioassay of transgenic lines against r. solani exhibited an average of 55 % reduction in sheath blight percentage disease index .
immunohistofluorescence analysis of various tissue sections of plant parts clearly indicated the constitutive expression of masal.

the expression of masal was confirmed in t <dig> and t <dig> plants through western blot analysis followed by elisa.
rice sheath blight, caused by rhizoctonia solani is one of the most devastating diseases of rice.
