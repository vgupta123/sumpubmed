we examined the genetic neighborhood of the different subfamily genes and discovered conserved gene clusters or operons associated with specific nitrilase clades.
the inferred evolutionary transitions that separate nitrilases which belong to different gene clusters correlated with changes in their enzymatic properties.
changes in the observed biochemical properties of the nitrilases associated with the different gene clusters are consistent with a hypothesis that those enzymes have been recruited to a novel metabolic pathway following gene duplication and neofunctionalization.
nitrilases are relatively rare in bacterial genomes, their biological function being unclear.
these results demonstrate the benefits of combining environmental genomic sampling and completed genomes data with evolutionary and biochemical analyses in the study of gene families.
we present evidence that darwinian adaptation acted during one of those transitions and identified sites in the enzyme that may have been under positive selection.
completed genomes and environmental genomic sequences are bringing a significant contribution to understanding the evolution of gene families, microbial metabolism and community eco-physiology.
