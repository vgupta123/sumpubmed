vespa is demonstrated on two use cases  to demonstrate the rapid manner in which mis-annotations can be found and explored in vespa using either proteomics data alone, or in combination with transcriptomic data.
we present visual exploration and statistics to promote annotation  is a new interactive visual analysis software tool focused on assisting scientists with the annotation of prokaryotic genomes though the integration of proteomics and transcriptomics data with current genome location coordinates.
vespa is an interactive visual analytics tool that integrates high-throughput data into a genomic context to facilitate the discovery of structural mis-annotations in prokaryotic genomes.
the procedural aspects of genome sequencing and assembly have become relatively inexpensive, yet the full, accurate structural annotation of these genomes remains a challenge.
next-generation sequencing transcriptomics , global microarrays, and tandem mass spectrometry -based proteomics have demonstrated immense value to genome curators as individual sources of information, however, integrating these data types to validate and improve structural annotation remains a major challenge.
search results are linked to exports for further validation outside of vespa or potential coding-regions can be analyzed concurrently with the software through interaction with blast.
vespa is a desktop javaâ„¢ application that integrates high-throughput proteomics data  and transcriptomics  data into a genomic context, all of which can be visualized at three levels of genomic resolution.
