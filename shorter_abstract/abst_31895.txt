in addition to basic keyword searches, genosis supports complex queries, including spatial queries, and dynamically generates genome maps.
genosis supports the generation of custom genome maps in response to complex queries about genome features based on both their attributes and locations.
in contrast to the paradigm of horizontally stacked data tracks used by most genome browsers, genosis uses the concept of registered spatial layers composed of spatial objects for integrated display of diverse data.
the genome features and their attributes are represented as spatial objects and data layers that can be toggled on and off according to user preferences or displayed selectively in response to user queries.
we implemented an interactive genome sequence feature map for the mouse genome in genosis, an application that uses arcgis, a commercially available gis software system.
our example application of genosis to the mouse genome demonstrates the powerful visualization and query capability of mature gis technology applied in a novel domain.
many commonly used genome browsers display sequence annotations and related attributes as horizontal data tracks that can be toggled on and off according to user preferences.
most genome browsers use only simple keyword searches and limit the display of detailed annotations to one chromosomal region of the genome at a time.
our adaptation of the geographic information system  model in a genome context supports spatial representation of genome features at multiple scales with a versatile and expressive query capability beyond that supported by existing genome browsers.
one of the unique capabilities of genosis compared to existing genome browsers is the capacity to generate genome feature maps dynamically in response to complex attribute and spatial queries.
