interestingly, we observe that loss of autophagy leads to a precocious activation of the notch pathway in the fcs as monitored by the expression of cut and hindsight, two downstream effectors of notch signaling.
generation of autophagy-deficient fcs leads to a wide range of phenotypes that are similar to mutants with defects in the classical cell-cell signaling pathways in the ovary.
however, the lack of autophagy only affects oogenesis when fcs are autophagy-deficient but gcs are wild type, indicating that a dysfunctional signaling between soma and germline may be responsible for the oogenesis defects.
our findings point to an unexpected function for autophagy in the modulation of the notch signaling pathway during drosophila oogenesis and suggest a function for autophagy in proper receptor activation.
egg development is affected by an imbalance of autophagy between signal sending  and signal receiving cell , thus the lack of autophagy in the germline is likely to decrease the amount of active ligand and accordingly compensates for increased signaling in autophagy-defective follicle cells.
we recently demonstrated that egg development depends on autophagy in the somatic follicle cells , but not in the germline cells .
thus, autophagy could play an essential role in modulating signal transduction pathways during egg development.
