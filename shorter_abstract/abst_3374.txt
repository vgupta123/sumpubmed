defining blocks forming the global protein structure on the basis of local structural regularity is a very fruitful idea, extensively used in description, and prediction of structure from only sequence information.
to search over fraglib database for a typical query protein with  <dig> residues.
a joined fraglib/sea server provides easy access to both algorithms, allowing a one stop alignment service using a novel approach to protein sequence alignment based on a network matching approach.
the joined fraglib/sea server will be a valuable tool both for molecular biologists working on protein sequence analysis and for bioinformaticians developing computational methods of structure prediction and alignment of proteins.
the fraglib algorithm takes ~ <dig> min.
the fraglib used as secondary structure prediction achieves only 73% accuracy in q <dig> measure, but when combined with the sea alignment, it achieves a significant improvement in pairwise sequence alignment quality, as compared to previous sea implementation and other public alignment algorithms.
