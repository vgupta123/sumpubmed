for strand bias, the average ratio of coverage between the forward and reverse strands at each nucleotide position indicated that two-thirds of the positions of the genome had ratios that were greater than  <dig> .
a few sites had more extreme strand bias.
depth of coverage variation and strand bias were identified but generally were infrequent and did not impact reliability of variant calls.
massively parallel sequencing  technologies have the capacity to sequence targeted regions or whole genomes of multiple nucleic acid samples with high coverage by sequencing millions of dna fragments simultaneously.
the objectives of this paper were to determine the feasibility, accuracy, and reliability of sequence data obtained from the pgm.
in this study, mtdna sequence data generated from the pgm were analyzed and the output evaluated.
overall, the results of this study, based on orthogonal concordance testing and phylogenetic scrutiny, supported that whole mtgenome sequence data with high accuracy can be obtained using the pgm platform.
in this study, whole genomes of human mitochondria  were sequenced on the personal genome machine  , the out data were assessed, and the results were compared with data previously generated on the miseqtm .
the total  <dig>  variants were concordant between the results from the pgm and miseq.
compared with sanger sequencing, mps also can reduce labor and cost on a per nucleotide basis and indeed on a per sample basis.
the quality scores for haplogroup assignment for all  <dig> samples ranged between  <dig> %-100%.
the depth of coverage pattern was similar among all  <dig> samples; however the coverage across the genome varied.
