in this comparative structure based study, we have used interaction energies between amino acids, to generate structure networks called as protein energy networks .
despite their structural and functional similarities with their mesophilic homologues, they show enhanced stability.
we also observe no community of electrostatic cliques forming in pens.
the results show an increased number of clusters and low energy cliques in thermophiles as the main contributing factors for their enhanced stability.
the thermophiles have a better-packed hydrophobic core.
these pens are used to compute network, sub-graph, and node specific parameters.
these parameters are then compared between the thermophile-mesophile homologues.
