we report here a large-scale transcriptomics study using the affymetrix wheat genechipÂ® aimed at providing this link between wheat and model systems and at identifying early meiotic genes.
bread wheat is an allohexaploid that behaves as a diploid during meiosis.
analysis of the microarray data identified  <dig>  transcripts temporally-regulated during the early stages of meiosis.
expression profiles with annotated transcript functions including chromatin condensation, synaptonemal complex formation, recombination and fertility were identified.
from the  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig> displayed at least an eight-fold expression change between and including pre-meiosis and telophase ii, with more than 50% of these having no similarities to known sequences in ncbi and tigr databases.
this resource is now available to support research into the molecular basis of pairing and recombination control in the complex polyploid, wheat.
the rapid advance of biochemical and molecular information on meiosis in model organisms such as yeast provides new opportunities to investigate the molecular basis of chromosome pairing control in wheat.
