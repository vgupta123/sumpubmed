we developed a revised version of our finite supragenome model to estimate the size of the s. aureus supragenome , and compared it with those of haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae.
staphylococcus aureus is associated with a spectrum of symbiotic relationships with its human host from carriage to sepsis and is frequently associated with nosocomial and community-acquired infections, thus the differential gene content among strains is of interest.
using a multi-species comparative supragenomic analysis enabled by an improved version of our finite supragenome model we provide data and an interpretation explaining the relatively larger core genome of s. aureus compared to other opportunistic nasopharyngeal pathogens.
we sequenced three clinical strains and combined these data with  <dig> publically available human isolates and one bovine strain for comparative genomic analyses.
gene-content comparisons among all possible s. aureus strain pairs  revealed a mean difference of  <dig> genes and a maximum difference of  <dig> genes.
individual genomes contained between  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes.
