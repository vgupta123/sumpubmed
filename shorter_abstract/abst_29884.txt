additionally, we did not detect any other particular substructure linked to different hosts.
our work shows a rare example of a very strong effect of a resistance gene on pathogen populations.
the balance between gene flow and selection determines the maintenance of such a structure in sympatry.
however, an isolation-by-distance  pattern at the orchard scale revealed free gene flow within each subpopulation.

inferences were drawn from microsatellite and aflp data obtained from  <dig> strains sampled in a single orchard on nine different malus species to determine the forces that shape the genetic structure of the pathogen.
moreover, detection of an ibd pattern at the orchard scale revealed a very low average dispersal distance that is particularly significant for epidemiologists and landscape managers for the design of scab control strategies
in this article, we analysed the genetic structure of the population of the apple scab fungus, venturia inaequalis, in a heterogeneous environment composed of various malus species.
despite the high diversity of malus hosts, the presence of rvi <dig> seems sufficient to explain the observed genetic structure.
using clustering methods, we first identified two specialist subpopulations:  a virulent subpopulation sampled on malus trees carrying the rvi <dig> resistance gene; and  a subpopulation infecting only malus trees that did not carry this resistance gene.
a genome scan of loci on these two subpopulations did not detect any locus under selection.
