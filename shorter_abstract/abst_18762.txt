it allows for efficient and perfectly parallelized functional annotation of coevolution found at the sequence level.
at the same time reduced molecular models are an efficient way to determine the reduced dynamics around the native state.
our package is a first step to achieve the above mentioned annotation of coevolution by reduced dynamics around the native state of proteins.
using sequence-based and information theoretical inspired methods we can identify coevolving residues in proteins without understanding the underlying biophysical properties giving rise to such coevolutionary dynamics.
with the r package biophysconnector we provide a framework to connect the information theoretical domain of biomolecular sequences to biophysical properties of the encoded molecules - derived from reduced molecular models.
