studying retinoid acid  response of sh-sy5y cell line, a model of human metastatic neuroblastoma, we found that hoxd-as <dig> is a subject to morphogenic regulation, is activated by pi3k/akt pathway and itself is involved in control of ra-induced cell differentiation.
knock-down experiments revealed that hoxd-as <dig> controls expression levels of clinically significant protein-coding genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation, the hallmarks of metastatic cancer.
this resource can be utilized to interrogate existing microarray datasets for various lncrna studies.
significant fraction of lncrnas is represented on widely used microarray platforms, however they have usually been ignored in cancer studies.
we developed a computational pipeline to annotate lncrnas on popular affymetrix u <dig> microarrays, creating a resource allowing measurement of expression of  <dig> lncrnas.
analysis of an independent patient cohort revealed that this signature differentiates also relapsing from non-relapsing primary tumors.
this annotation was applied to microarray analysis which identified a  <dig> lncrna signature that discriminates between localized and metastatic stages of neuroblastoma.
one of these lncrnas, termed hoxd-as <dig>  is encoded in hoxd cluster.
