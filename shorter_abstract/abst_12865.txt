pigs housed in a natural outdoor environment showed a dominance of firmicutes, in particular lactobacillus, whereas animals housed in a hygienic indoor environment had reduced lactobacillus and higher numbers of potentially pathogenic phylotypes.
the extent to which early-life environment impacts on microbial diversity of the adult gut and subsequent immune processes has not been comprehensively investigated thus far.
analysis of over  <dig>  16s rrna sequences revealed major differences in mucosa-adherent microbial diversity in the ileum of adult pigs attributable to differences in early-life environment.
we observed that a microbiota dominated by lactobacilli may function to maintain mucosal immune homeostasis and limit pathogen colonization.
we addressed this important question using the pig as a model to evaluate the impact of early-life environment on microbe/host gut interactions during development.
affymetrix microarray technology and real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed significant gut-specific gene responses also related to early-life environment.
early-life environment significantly affects both microbial composition of the adult gut and mucosal innate immune function.
gene ontology and pathway analysis further confirmed these results.
early microbial colonization of the gut reduces the incidence of infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
recent population studies reveal that childhood hygiene is a significant risk factor for development of inflammatory bowel disease, thereby reinforcing the hygiene hypothesis and the potential importance of microbial colonization during early life.
genetically-related piglets were housed in either indoor or outdoor environments or in experimental isolators.
significantly, indoor-housed pigs displayed increased expression of type  <dig> interferon genes, major histocompatibility complex class i and several chemokines.
