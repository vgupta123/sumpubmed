blood pb levels of pb-exposed cinereous vultures were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g shortly after intoxication, decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g without any therapy in a month and to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g one month after cana2edta administration.
laboratory analyses confirmed severe liver and kidney damage and anaemia.
liver, kidney and blood lead concentrations were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/g, respectively.
a chick in an egg produced by a cinereous vulture female two months after lead toxicosis died on day  <dig> of artificial incubation.
soil contamination by lead-based paint sanded off the steel aviary resulted in poisoning of eight cinereous and two egyptian vultures.
iron levels in the lead-exposed pre-treatment birds significantly decreased after chelation.
creatine kinase was higher in pre-treatment birds than in the controls but normalised after therapy.
a marked increase in the level of lipid peroxidation measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive species was demonstrated in birds both prior to and after chelation.
the reported blood parameters and reproduction impairment in captive birds may have implications for professionals dealing with lead exposure in wild birds.
reduced glutathione dropped after cana2edta therapy, while oxidised glutathione was significantly lower in both pre- and post-treatment birds.
eight months later, blood lead levels decreased to close to the background of the control group.
lead concentrations in foetal tissues were consistent with levels causing avian mortality.
blood parameters of healthy pb-non-exposed cinereous vultures were compared with those of the exposed group prior to and after chelation therapy.
