given the complex nature of cardiovascular disease , information derived from a systems-level will allow us to fully interrogate features of cvd to better understand disease pathogenesis and to identify new drug targets.
we also characterize the relationships between different cardiovascular disorders, which reveal that they share more etiological commonalities with each other rooted in the global disease-disease networks.
we have identified  <dig> effect-mediating drug targets, which are modulated by  <dig> unique drugs, of which, 43% display activities across different protein families , highlighting the fact that multitarget therapy is suitable for cvd.
here, we describe a systematic assessment of the multi-layer interactions underlying cardiovascular drugs, targets, genes and disorders to reveal comprehensive insights into cardiovascular systems biology and pharmacology.
although there is little overlap between cardiovascular protein targets and disease genes, the two groups have similar pleiotropy and intimate relationships in the human disease gene-gene and cellular networks, supporting their similar characteristics in disease development and response to therapy.
