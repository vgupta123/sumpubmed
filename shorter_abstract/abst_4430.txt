the 3′ splice site  at the end of pre-mrna introns has a consensus sequence nnyag for constitutive splicing of mammalian genes.
taking it a step further, we searched the human genome for purine-rich elements between the - <dig> and - <dig> positions of the 3′ splice sites of annotated introns.

these sites deviate significantly from the consensus of constitutive splice sites and are highly associated with alterative splicing events, particularly alternative 3′ splice and intron retention.
we show by mutagenesis analysis and rna interference that the g tracts are splicing silencers and a group of the associated exons are controlled by the g tract binding proteins hnrnp h/f.
species comparison of a group of the 3′ss among vertebrates suggests that most  of the g tracts emerged in ancestors of mammals during evolution.
this evolutionary change controls alternative splicing, likely to diversify proteomes for particular cellular functions.
the emergence of repa in this highly constrained region indicates that this location has been remarkably permissive for the emergence of de novo regulatory rna elements, even purine-rich motifs, in a large group of mammalian genes during evolution.
this identified several thousand such 3′ss; more than a thousand of them contain at least one copy of g tract.
moreover, the host genes are most significantly associated with cancer.
