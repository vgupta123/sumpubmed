next, we characterized the expression of proapoptotic mirnas, including mir- <dig>  let-7a and mir-34a in distinct models of neural differentiation, including mouse embryonic stem cells, pc <dig> and nt2n cells.
recently, we have shown that apoptosis-associated factors, such as p <dig> and caspases participate in the differentiation process of mouse neural stem  cells.
the results provide new insights into the regulation of neuronal differentiation by apoptosis-associated mirnas.
to identify apoptosis-associated mirnas that might play a role in neuronal development, we performed global mirna expression profiling experiments in ns cells.
overexpression of mir-34a increased the proportion of postmitotic neurons of mouse ns cells.
in contrast, expression of mir-19a and mir-20a was downregulated in mouse ns cell differentiation.
in addition, the expression of antiapoptotic mir-19a and 20a was also evaluated.
in conclusion, the identification of mir- <dig>  let-7a and mir-34a, whose expression patterns are conserved in mouse, rat and human neural differentiation, implicates these specific mirnas in mammalian neuronal development.
the expression of mir- <dig>  let-7a and mir-34a was consistently upregulated in neural differentiation models.
importantly, differential expression of specific apoptosis-related mirnas was not associated with increased cell death.
