the commercial oil palm  produces a mesocarp oil  with approximately equal proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids .
one way to manipulate the fatty acid composition  in palm oil is through introgression of favourable alleles from the american oil palm, e. oleifera, which has a more unsaturated oil.
in this study, a segregating e. oleifera x e. guineensis  hybrid population for fac is used to identify quantitative trait loci  linked to iv and various fas.
clustering trait values according to the allelic forms of these candidate markers revealed significant differences in the iv and fas of the palms in the mapping and validation crosses.
qtl analysis revealed  <dig> major and two putative qtls for iv and six fas, c14: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> distributed across six linkage groups , ot <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  ot <dig>  ot <dig> and t <dig>  the major qtls for iv and c16: <dig> on lgot <dig> explained  <dig>  –  <dig>  % of the phenotypic trait variation and were validated in two independent bc <dig> populations.
an increase in unsaturated fas content or iodine value  as a measure of the degree of unsaturation would help to open up new markets for the oil.

using the whole genome sequence data, markers tightly linked to the candidate genes were also developed.
the candidate gene approach described and exploited here is useful to identify the potential causal genes linked to fac and can be adopted for marker-assisted selection  in oil palm.
