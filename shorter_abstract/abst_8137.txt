this plant is an obligate halophyte that grows optimally from 200– <dig> mm nacl and can grow at up to  <dig> mm nacl.
suaeda fruticosa is an annual shrub in the family chenopodiaceae found in coastal and inland regions of pakistan and mediterranean shores.
the transcriptome may serve as a reference sequence for study of other succulent halophytes.
blast analysis identified the differentially expressed genes, which were categorized in gene ontology terms and their pathways.
this has stimulated research on salt tolerance in plants.
however, little is known about the genes involved in salt tolerance.
high throughput sequencing technology was performed to provide understanding of genes involved in the salt tolerance mechanism.
this work has identified potential genes involved in salt tolerance in suaeda fruticosa, and has provided an outline of tools to use for de novo transcriptome analysis.
the assemblies that were used provide coverage of a considerable proportion of the transcriptome, which allows analysis of differential gene expression and identification of genes that may be involved in salt tolerance.
we have characterized the transcriptome of suaeda fruticosa, a halophyte that has the ability to sequester salts in its leaves.
twelve sequencing libraries prepared from control  and optimum  plants were sequenced using illumina hiseq  <dig> to investigate differential gene expression between shoots and roots of suaeda fruticosa.
