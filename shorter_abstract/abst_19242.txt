multiple isozymes are produced by tissue-specific differential processing of pklr mrna.
the disease results from mutations in pklr, the gene encoding the regulatory glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase .
additional signs include: severe lethargy, weakness, weight loss, jaundice, and abdominal enlargement.
pk testing is recommended for bengals, egyptian maus, la perms, maine coon cats, norwegian forest cats, savannahs, siberians, and singapuras, in addition to abyssinians and somalis as well an any new breeds using the afore mentioned breeds in out crossing or development programs.

sequence analysis of pklr revealed an intron  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  at position  <dig> concordant with the disease phenotype in abyssinian and somali cats.
in domestic cats, pk deficiency has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance with high variability in onset and severity of clinical symptoms.

erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency  is an inherited hemolytic anemia that has been documented in the abyssinian and somali breeds as well as random bred domestic shorthair cats.
