physical and otoscopic examination at t <dig> revealed monolateral and bilateral otorrhea in  <dig> and  <dig> calves, respectively, with peripheral vestibular system involvement in calves presenting with neurological signs .
the therapeutic protocol consisted of tulathromycin , oxytetracycline hydrochloride , and carprofen .
the aims of this field trial were to describe the clinical-pathologic findings in calves with otitis media  and media-interna , to evaluate, through the development of a scoring system, the effectiveness of a standardized therapeutic protocol, and to identify the causative pathogens and their possible correlation with concurrent respiratory disease.
this is the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized therapeutic protocol for the treatment of om/omi in calves.
persistence of mild clinical-neurological signs did not compromise productive performance.
the numerical scoring system for clinical and neurological signs permitted objective evaluation of response to therapy.
follow-up telephone interviews with animal owners were conducted 1 month later.
all animals underwent physical and neurological examinations at three experimental time points: at diagnosis/beginning of treatment , 1 week  and 2 weeks  after therapy was started, respectively.
m. bovis either alone or together with these bacteria was also isolated from the upper and/or lower respiratory tract in  <dig>  calves.
m. bovis was the pathogen most often isolated.
mycoplasma bovis was isolated in 89 % of the affected ears either alone or together with p. multocida , streptococcus spp.
moreover, respiratory tract infection should not be underrated, since it is one of the major risk factors for the development of om/omi.
a significant improvement of clinical and neurological scores was observed in  <dig>  calves, a full recovery in only  <dig> .
