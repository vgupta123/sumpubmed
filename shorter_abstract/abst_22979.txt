in plants, the snorna genes are organized in clusters, transcribed by rna pol ii from a common promoter and subsequently processed into mature molecules.
finally, we have identified two dicistronic genes encoding precursors that are processed to mature snorna and mirna molecules.
in order to identify novel ncrna genes, we have used the snorna telo-box/site ii motifs combination as a functional promoter indicator to screen the arabidopsis genome.
we also show evidence for  <dig> novel ncrnas that lack similarity to any reported rna family.
the promoter regions of snorna polycistronic genes in plants are highly enriched in two conserved cis-regulatory elements , telo-box and site ii, which coordinate the expression of snornas and ribosomal protein coding genes throughout the cell cycle.

the predictions generated by this process were tested by detailed exploration of available rna-seq and expression data sets and experimental validation.
both target chemical modifications of ribosomal rnas  and small nuclear rnas .
in the past few decades, non-coding rnas  have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes.
