the new method simplifies the process of viability analysis and allows a quick and accurate analysis.
in this paper we present a new and fast viability assay for unicellular cyanobacteria, which uses red chlorophyll fluorescence and an unspecific green autofluorescence for the differentiation of viable and non-viable cells without the need of sample preparation.
the use of an automated fluorescence microscope and a novel imagej based image analysis plugin allow a semi-automated analysis.
the viability assay for unicellular cyanobacteria using red and green autofluorescence was established and validated for the model organism synechocystis sp.
the results were confirmed by plating/colony count, absorption spectra and chlorophyll measurements.
furthermore results indicate that a combination of the new assay with absorption spectra or chlorophyll concentration measurements allows the estimation of the vitality of cells.
currently established methods to identify viable and non-viable cells of cyanobacteria are either time-consuming  or preparation-intensive .
pcc  <dig>  both autofluorescence signals could be observed simultaneously allowing a direct classification of viable and non-viable cells.
