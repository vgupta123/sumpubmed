total peroxidase and laccase activities were elevated in infested plants at 10-dai relative to control uninfested plants.
expression changes in genes linked to redox metabolism, cell wall structure, and hormone biosynthesis were also observed by 5-dai.
the net result appeared to be a broad scale defensive response that led to an apparent reduction in c and n assimilation and a potential redirection of nutrients away from gb and towards the production of defensive compounds, such as pipecolic acid, chlorogenic acid, and trehalose by 10-dai.

these results can be exploited to develop switchgrass lines with more durable resistance to gb and potentially other aphids.
degs in gb-infested plants induced by 5-dai included an upregulation of reactive burst oxidases and several cell wall receptors.
supporting these molecular changes, chlorophyll content was significantly decreased, and ros levels were elevated in infested plants 10-dai.
at 10-dai, network analysis indicated a massive upregulation of defense-associated genes, including nac, wrky, and myb classes of transcription factors and potential ancillary signaling molecules such as leucine aminopeptidases.
by 15-dai, evidence of recovery in primary metabolism was noted based on transcript abundances for genes associated with carbon, nitrogen, and nutrient assimilation.
the early loss and apparent recovery in primary metabolism by 15-dai would suggest that these transcriptional changes in later stages of gb infestation could underlie the recovery response categorized for this switchgrass cultivar.
differentially expressed genes  in infested plants were analyzed relative to control uninfested plants at each time point.
molecular evidence for loss of chloroplastic functions was also detected at this time point.
