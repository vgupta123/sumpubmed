in high-dimensional data analysis such as differential gene expression analysis, people often use filtering methods like fold-change or variance filters in an attempt to reduce the multiple testing penalty and improve power.
we illustrate our results using both a simulation study and an experimental dataset, where the fdr is shown to be biased mostly by filters that are associated with the hypothesis being tested, such as the fold change.
the precise amount of bias depends on many quantities, such as fraction of probes filtered out, filter statistic and test statistic used.
we show that a biased multiple testing correction results if non-differentially expressed probes are not filtered out with equal probability from the entire range of p-values.
researchers can use our test for fdr bias to guide their choice of filter and amount of filtering in practice.
finally, we propose a statistical test that can be used in practice to determine whether any chosen filter introduces bias on the fdr estimate used, given a general experimental setup.
