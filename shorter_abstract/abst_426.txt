single cell analysis of the expression kinetics of the differentiation marker cd11b  revealed all-or-none switch-like behavior, in contrast to the seemingly graduated change of expression when measured as a population average.
instead, mammalian differentiation appears to be a multi-step process in a high-dimensional system, a result which is consistent with the high connectivity of the cells' complex underlying gene regulatory network.
here we studied how hl <dig> promyelocytic precursor cells transition to the neutrophil cell lineage after stimulation with the differentiation inducer, dimethyl sulfoxide .
progression from the precursor to the differentiated state was detected as a discrete transition between low  and high  expressor subpopulations distinguishable in a bimodal distribution.
cell differentiation has long been theorized to represent a switch in a bistable system, and recent experimental work in micro-organisms has revealed bistable dynamics in small gene regulatory circuits.
hysteresis in the dependence of cd11b expression on dmso dose suggests that this bimodality may reflect a bistable dynamic.
however, the dynamics of mammalian cell differentiation has not been analyzed with respect to bistability.
