violacein is a purple pigment from chromobacterium violaceum that possesses diverse biological and pharmacological properties.
although punctual alterations in the antioxidant apparatus and increase in oxidative stress biomarkers was observed in some violacein concentrations, no association was found between increased oxidative stress and induction of cell death.
however, the cytotoxic mechanisms induced by violacein are poorly understood and the improvement in knowledge regarding these cell death mechanisms will be useful to develop new therapeutic approaches.

considering this, in our work, we investigated the pro-oxidant effects of violacein in non-tumor  and tumor  cell lines, searching for a better understanding of reactive oxygen species  production and cell death induction.
in fact, the increase of mitochondrial membrane potential in mrc- <dig> and hela cells suggests that mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization might be the main cause of cell death triggered by violacein.
however, the increase of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed.
cytotoxicity induced by violacein was observed in the three cell lines; however, mrc- <dig> and hela cells were shown to be more sensitive to violacein treatment.
