multiplex real time pcr is increasingly used to diagnose respiratory viruses in humans and has proved to be superior to traditional methods.
a mrt-qpcr assay was developed and optimised for the simultaneous detection of bovine respiratory syncytial virus , bovine herpes virus type  <dig>  and bovine parainfluenza virus type  <dig>  nucleic acids in clinical samples from cattle.
the assay targets the highly conserved glycoprotein b gene of bohv- <dig>  nucleocapsid gene of brsv and nucleoprotein gene of bpi <dig>  this mrt-qpcr assay was assessed for sensitivity, specificity and repeatability using in vitro transcribed rna and recent field isolates.
the mrt-qpcr assay was rapid, highly repeatable, specific and had a sensitivity of 97% in detecting  <dig> copies of brsv, bohv- <dig> and bpi <dig> i & ii.
bovine respiratory disease  is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in housed cattle and virus infections can play a major role.
