multiple alignments of tyrosine kinase  and vft domains indicated their important level of conservation in all vkrs identified up to date.
we showed that vkrs had inducible activity upon binding of extracellular amino-acids and molecular modeling of the vft domain confirmed the structure of the conserved amino-acid binding site.
this little-known rtk family deserves to be further explored in order to determine its evolutionary origin, its possible interest for the emergence and specialization of metazoa, and to understand its function in invertebrate development and/or reproductive biology.
receptor tyrosine kinases  form a family of transmembrane proteins widely conserved in metazoa, with key functions in cell-to-cell communication and control of multiple cellular processes.
this study highlights the presence of vkr in a large number of invertebrates, including primitive metazoans like cnidarians, but also its absence from nematodes and chordates.
phylogenetic and gene structure analyses showed that the  <dig> receptors identified in  <dig> animal species grouped monophyletically, and likely evolved from a common ancestor.
vkr was shown to be highly expressed in the larval stages and gonads of several invertebrates, suggesting that it could have functions in development and/or reproduction.
