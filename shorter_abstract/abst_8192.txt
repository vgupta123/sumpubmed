human papillomavirus  <dig>  l <dig> protein has the capacity to self-assemble into capsomers or virus-like particles  that are highly immunogenic, allowing their use in vaccine production.
in this study, we report for the first time the transient expression and the self-assembly of a chimeric hpv- <dig> l <dig> bearing the m2e influenza epitope in plants, representing also the first record of a successful expression of chimeric hpv- <dig> l <dig> carrying an epitope of a heterologous virus in plants.
chimeras were recognized by a panel of linear and conformation-specific anti hpv- <dig> l <dig> mabs, and two of them also reacted with the anti-influenza mab.
electron microscopy showed that chimeric proteins made in plants spontaneously assembled in higher order structures, such as vlps of t =  <dig> or t =  <dig> symmetry, or capsomers.
a synthetic hpv- <dig> l <dig> gene optimized with human codon usage was used as a backbone gene to design four chimeric sequences containing either the m2e2- <dig> or the m2e2- <dig> epitope in two predicted surface-exposed l <dig> positions.
we investigated the potential of hpv- <dig> l <dig> to act as a carrier of two foreign epitopes from influenza a virus:  m2e2- <dig>  ectodomain of the m <dig> protein , that is highly conserved among all influenza a isolates, or  m2e2- <dig>  a shorter version of m2e containing the n-terminal highly conserved epitope, that is common for both m <dig> and m <dig> influenza proteins.
all chimeric constructs were transiently expressed in plants using the cowpea mosaic virus-derived expression vector, peaq-ht.
