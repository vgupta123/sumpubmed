six typhimurium strains of different phage types  were analysed using illumina high-throughput genome sequencing.
unique genetic elements that were common between host-adapted phage types were not found.
four strains carried the 90-kb plasmid pslt which contains several known virulence genes.
nine prophage or prophage remnants were identified in the six strains.
typhimurium is a broad host range serovar but has also evolved into host-adapted variants .
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is the most common serovar in both human infections and farm animals in australia and many other countries.
the genome data suggest that variations between strains were mainly due to accumulation of snps, some of which resulted in gene inactivation.
in addition, one strain had a novel plasmid similar to typhi strain ct <dig> plasmid phcm <dig>
variations between strains were mainly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms  with an average of  <dig> snps per strain, ranging from  <dig> snps to  <dig> snps.
