the amount of transcription factor binding sites  in an organism’s genome positively correlates with the complexity of the regulatory network of the organism.
based on this finding, we hypothesize that the amount of ncdna, combined with the population size, can explain the patterns of regulatory complexity across organisms.
we analyzed tfbs data from five model organisms – e. coli k <dig>  s. cerevisiae, c. elegans, d. melanogaster, a. thaliana – and found a positive correlation between the amount of non-coding dna  in the organism’s genome and regulatory complexity.
the cis-regulome is not a clean functional network crafted by adaptive forces alone, but instead a data source filled with the noise of non-adaptive forces.
from a regulatory perspective, this evolutionary noise manifests as complexity on both the binding site and pathway level, which has significant implications on many directions in microbiology, genetics, and synthetic biology.
the results support our hypothesis, showing neutral evolutionary forces alone can explain tfbs patterns, and that selection on the regulatory network function does not alter this finding.
