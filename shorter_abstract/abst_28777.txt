the results showed that co inhibited: 1) tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase -positive cell formation; 2) f-actin ring production; 3) c-fos pathway activation; 4) the expression of cathepsin k, trap, calcitonin receptor, and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> mrnas; 5) the expression of nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent  <dig> in translation.
low concentrations of carbon monoxide  are known to decrease inflammation and oc-mediated bone erosion but the molecular mechanism is unknown.
our study provides the first interactome analysis of osteoclastogenesis, the results of which supported the negative regulation of oc differentiation by co.
excess oc production plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bone disorders.
during osteoclastogenesis, the maturation of osteoclast  progenitors is stimulated by the receptor activator of nuclear factor-Îºb ligand .
low-concentrations of co  may inhibit osteoclastogenesis.
conversely, the inhibition of abnormal oc proliferation reduces inflammation-induced bone loss.
data from string- and ipa-based interactome analyses suggested that the expression of proteins with the functions of signal transduction, enzymes, and epigenetic regulation are significantly altered by co during rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis.
