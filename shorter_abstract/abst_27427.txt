the evolutionary history of dha <dig>  arn and gex genes was reconstructed and a common evolutionary root shared by the encoded proteins is hypothesized.
arn1/arn <dig> homologs were only found in species belonging to the saccharomyces complex and are more abundant in the pre-wgd species.
the s. cerevisiae dha <dig> proteins sge <dig>  azr <dig>  vba <dig> and vba <dig> co-clustered in a large phylogenetic branch, the atr <dig> and ymr279c genes were proposed to be paralogs formed during the whole genome duplication  whereas the closely related orf yor378w resides in its own lineage.
arn <dig> homologs were only found in sub-telomeric regions of species belonging to the sacharomyces sensu strictu group .
the evolutionary history of dha <dig>  arn and gex genes, encoding 14-spanner mfs transporters, is reconstructed in this study.
a new protein family, denominated dag, is proposed to span these three phylogenetic subfamilies of 14-spanner mfs transporters.

gene neighbourhood analysis was combined with tree construction methodologies to reconstruct their evolutionary history and  <dig> dha <dig> gene lineages,  <dig> arn gene lineages, and  <dig> gex gene lineage, were identified.
the constraining and traversing of a network representing the pairwise similarity data gathered  <dig> full size proteins and retrieved arn and gex family members together with dha <dig> transporters, suggesting the existence of a close phylogenetic relationship among these 14-spanner major facilitators.
the saccharomyces cerevisiae 14-spanner drug:h+ antiporter family  <dig>  are transporters of the major facilitator superfamily  involved in multidrug resistance .
in s. cerevisiae, the four arn/sit family members encode siderophore transporters and the two gex family members encode glutathione extrusion pumps.
homologs of s. cerevisiae dha <dig> vacuolar proteins vba <dig>  vba <dig> and vba <dig> occur widespread in the hemiascomycetes.
