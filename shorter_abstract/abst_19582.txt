this issue is examined here in light of molecular data sets composed of dna sequences for nuclear and mitochondrial loci, and a published character data set of anatomical and shell morphological characters.
recent morphological treatment of selected pterioideans and molecular phylogenetic analyses of higher-level relationships in bivalvia have challenged the traditional view that pterioidean families are monophyletic.
the present study is the first comprehensive species-level analysis of the pterioidea to produce a well-resolved, robust phylogenetic hypothesis for nearly all extant taxa.
four primary conclusions were reached:  the results strongly supported the monophyly of the pterioidea;  none of the previously defined families  were monophyletic;  the arrangement of the genera was novel and unanticipated, however strongly supported and robust to changes in alignment parameters; and  optimizing key morphological characters onto topologies derived from the analysis of molecular data revealed many instances of homoplasy and uncovered synapomorphies for major nodes.
the congruence and contribution of different partitions were quantified, and the sensitivity of clade stability to alignment parameters was explored.
the data were analyzed for potential biases due to taxon and character sampling, and idiosyncracies of different molecular evolutionary processes.
additionally, a complete species-level sampling of the genus pinctada provided further insights into the on-going controversy regarding the taxonomic identity of major pearl culture species.
