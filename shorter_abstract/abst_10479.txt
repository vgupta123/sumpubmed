the tpr of s. cerevisiae est <dig> is required for telomerase-mediated telomere length maintenance in a manner that appears separable from telomere recruitment.
the human counterparts est1a, est1b, and est1c perform diverse functions in nonsense-mediated mrna decay , telomere length homeostasis, and telomere transcription.
these results identify a domain encompassing the tpr of hest1a as an htert interaction module.
two mutations within the htert n-terminus that perturb in vivo function  did not affect this protein interaction.
discrete residues in or adjacent to the tpr of est <dig> also regulate telomere length homeostasis.
