we establish for the first time the spatial expression patterns of nearly  <dig> mirnas in multiple normal tissues  of bombyx mori females and males using microarray and northern-blotting analyses.
expression patterns of five mirnas were significantly increased during metamorphosis in all four tissues , and two mirna pairs, bmo-mir-10b-3p/5p and bmo-mir-281-3p/5p, showed coordinate expression.
periods of rapid morphological change were associated with alterations in mirna expression patterns in the body wall, silk glands, midgut and fat body during metamorphosis.
in total,  <dig> mirnas displayed significant alterations in abundance in at least  <dig> tissue during the developmental transition from larvae to pupae .
micrornas  repress target genes at the post-transcriptional level, and function in the development and cell-lineage pathways of host species.
additionally, we examined the developmental patterns of mirna expression during metamorphosis of the body wall, silk glands, midgut and fat body.
these results should facilitate future functional analyses.
accordingly, we propose that corresponding ubiquitous or tissue-specific expression of mirnas supports their critical roles in tissue specification.
