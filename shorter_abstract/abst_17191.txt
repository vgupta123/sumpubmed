the results of mass spectrometry indicated that the 25-kda band corresponded to the hypothetical cytochrome c subunit encoded by the orf ape_ <dig> .
the redox spectrum of the isolated c-type cytochrome showed a characteristic α-band peak at  <dig> nm corresponding to heme c. the pyridine hemochrome spectrum also revealed the presence of heme b. in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the cytochrome migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda, and successive sds-page separated the 80-kda band into  <dig> polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda.
however, an electron donor candidates for cytochrome c oxidase, such as a blue copper protein, have not yet been identified in the whole genome data of this archaeon.
in contrast to terminal oxidases, a canonical bc <dig> complex has not yet been isolated from archaea.
we are currently trying to identify an authentic substrate between a bc complex and terminal oxidase.
in conclusion, we showed that a. pernix, a hyperthemophilic archaeon, has a "full" bc complex that includes a c-type cytochrome, and to the best of our knowledge, a. pernix is the first archaea from which such a bc complex has been identified.
here, we isolated a c-type cytochrome-containing enzyme complex from the membranes of the hyperthermophilic archaeon, aeropyrum pernix, grown aerobically.
in particular, c-type cytochromes have been reported only for a limited number of species.
in addition, the c-type cytochrome-containing polypeptide complex exhibited menaquinone: yeast cytochrome c oxidoreductase activities.
