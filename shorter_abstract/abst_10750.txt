the main objectives of this study were to compare mrna expression of inflammation-related genes, as well as adipocyte morphology and number between different equine at depots; and in addition, to investigate the presence of antigen presenting cells in equine at and any potential relationship with adipokine mrna expression.
by using genorm analysis, hprt <dig>  rpl <dig>  and gapdh were found to be the most stable genes in equine at.
for a correct interpretation of the rt-qpcr results, expression data have to be normalized by the use of validated reference genes.
in humans, adipose tissue  originating from different depots shows varying gene expression profiles.
adipose tissue location was associated with differences in mrna expression of inflammation-related genes.
no significant at depot effect was found for interleukin  <dig> and superoxide dismutase  <dig> .
adipocyte area and number of antigen presenting cells per adipocyte significantly differed between at depots .
reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , a useful method to evaluate differences in mrna expression across different tissues, can be used to evaluate differences between equine at depots.
in this study, the mrna expression of inflammation-related genes  and candidate reference gene stability was investigated in  <dig> different at depots collected from the nuchal, abdominal  and subcutaneous  at region.
the mrna expression of leptin, chemokine ligand  <dig>  interleukin  <dig>  interleukin 1Î², adiponectin, and matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> significantly differed across at depots .
this depot-specific difference in mrna expression suggests that the overall inflammatory status of horses could be partially determined by the relative proportion of the different at depots.
