this advances the possibility of: i) identifying subnetworks in a given pathway; ii) linking networks across different levels of granularity to address difficulties related to incomplete knowledge representation at single level; and iii) identifying common patterns between pathways in the database.
graphs are a natural way of representing biological networks.
they furthermore support queries on the structure of biological networks.
when modeling in systems biology and systems medicine, the data is often extensive, complex and heterogeneous.

ston imports and translates metabolic, signalling and gene regulatory pathways represented in the systems biology graphical notation into a graph-oriented format compatible with the neo4j graph database.
graph databases enable efficient storage and processing of the encoded biological relationships.
ston exploits the power of graph databases to store and query complex biological pathways.
