this research article consists of genomic annotation of the first draft of whole genome sequence of p. lilacinum.
de novo genomic assembly was done and a total of  <dig> scaffolds were constructed for p. lilacinum genomic dna.
the phylogenomic analysis carried out using maximum likelihood raxml algorithm provided insight into the evolutionary relationship of p. lilacinum.
in congruence with other closely related species in the hypocreales namely, metarhizium spp., pochonia chlamydosporia, cordyceps militaris, trichoderma reesei and fusarium spp., p. lilacinum has large gene sets coding for g-protein coupled receptors , proteases, glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate esterases that are required for degradation of nematode-egg shell components.
screening of the genome by antibiotics & secondary metabolite analysis shell  pipeline indicated that the genome potentially codes for a variety of secondary metabolites, possibly required for adaptation to heterogeneous lifestyles reported for p. lilacinum.

approximately 73 % of the predicted genes were functionally annotated using blastp, interproscan and gene ontology.
the study aims to decipher the putative genetic components of the fungus involved in nematode pathogenesis by performing comparative genomic analysis with nine closely related fungal species in hypocreales.
significant up-regulation of subtilisin-like serine protease genes in presence of nematode eggs in quantitative real-time analyses suggested potential role of serine proteases in nematode pathogenesis.
the fungus purpureocillium lilacinum is widely known as a biological control agent against plant parasitic nematodes.
