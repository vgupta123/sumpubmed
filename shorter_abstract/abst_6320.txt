blast searching of non-redundant databases returned  <dig>  significant matches and those gene families potentially encoding gene products involved in insecticide resistance were manually curated and annotated.
pyrosequencing produced around a million sequencing reads that assembled into  <dig>  contigs, with an average length of  <dig> bp, representing a dramatic expansion of existing cdna sequences available for t. vaporariorum .
here, we have developed new transcriptomic resources for t. vaporariorum.
these include a substantial and annotated est dataset that will serve the community studying this important crop pest and will elucidate further the molecular mechanisms underlying insecticide resistance.
these include, enzymes potentially involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and those encoding the targets of the major chemical classes of insecticides.
however, the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance have not been characterised and, to date, progress has been hampered by a lack of nucleotide sequence data for this species.
the whitefly trialeurodes vaporariorum is an economically important crop pest in temperate regions that has developed resistance to most classes of insecticides.
a total of  <dig> p450s,  <dig> gsts and  <dig> cces were identified along with  <dig> contigs encoding the target proteins of six different insecticide classes.
