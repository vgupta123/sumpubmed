the aim of this contest was to assess the performance of text mining systems applied to biomedical texts including tools which recognize named entities such as genes and proteins, and tools which automatically extract protein annotations.
within the emerging field of text mining and statistical natural language processing  applied to biomedical articles, a broad variety of techniques have been developed during the past years.
the combination of our approach with more refined statistical estimators and machine learning techniques might be a way to improve annotation extraction for future biomedical text mining applications.
we explored the use of averaging sentence sliding windows for information extraction, especially in a context where conventional training data is unavailable.
the "sentence sliding window" approach proposed here was found to efficiently extract text fragments from full text articles containing annotations on proteins, providing the highest number of correctly predicted annotations.
