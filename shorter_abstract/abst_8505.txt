we apply our method to colon and to breast cancer samples, for which genome-wide copy number, methylation and gene expression profiles are available.
<dig> to consider the effect of not just copy number, but also of other molecular profiles such as methylation changes and loss-of-heterozigosity , on gene expression levels.
our findings include interesting gene expression-regulating mechanisms, which may involve only one of copy number or methylation, or both for the same samples.
we will consider again sets of measurements, to improve robustness of results and increase the power to find associations.
this gene-set modelling framework was later applied to find associations between mrna expression and microrna expression, by defining the gene sets using target prediction information.
our method can equally well be applied to cases where other types of molecular  data are collected, such as loh, snp genotype and microrna expression data.
