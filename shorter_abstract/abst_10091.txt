estrogens regulate diverse physiological processes in various tissues through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms that result in activation or repression of gene expression.
many gene targets of this network were not active anymore in anti-estrogen resistant cell lines, possibly because their dna methylation and histone acetylation patterns have changed.
we identified a number of estrogen regulated target genes and established estrogen-regulated network that distinguishes the genomic and non-genomic actions of estrogen receptor.
dynamic gene expression changes have been shown to characterize the breast cancer cell response to estrogens, the every molecular mechanism of which is still not well understood.
transcription regulation upon estrogen stimulation is a critical biological process underlying the onset and progress of the majority of breast cancer.
we developed a modulated empirical bayes model, and constructed a novel topological and temporal transcription factor  regulatory network in mcf <dig> breast cancer cell line upon stimulation by 17β-estradiol stimulation.
in mcf <dig> cells with acquired resistance to tamoxifen, the erα regulatory network was unresponsive to 17β-estradiol stimulation.
