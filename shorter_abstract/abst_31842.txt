through a series of double mutant analyses, we conclude that sa-dependent defense signaling does not require ocp <dig>  however, we found that ocp <dig> plants are impaired in a pseudomonas fluorescens wcs417r-triggered induced systemic resistance  against both pseudomonas syrinagae dc <dig> and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, and we show that this impairment is not due to a defect in ja-perception.
in arabidopsis, different types of induced resistance have been defined based on the signaling pathways involved, particularly those dependent on salicylic acid  and/or jasmonic acid .
our findings point to a model in which ocp <dig> may modulate the nucleocytosolic function of npr <dig> in the regulation of ja-dependent induced defense responses.
likewise, exogenous application of ja failed to induce defenses in ocp <dig> plants.
in addition, we provide evidence showing that the over-expression of an engineered cytosolic isoform of the disease resistance regulator npr <dig> restores the impaired ja-induced disease resistance in ocp <dig> plants.
