iaa enhanced spore formation and caused changes in colony morphology in the wild-type strain, but had no effect on spore formation or colony morphology of the cgopt1-silenced mutants.
cgopt1-silenced mutants produced less spores, had reduced pigmentation, and were less pathogenic to plants than the wild-type strain.
our results show that iaa induces developmental changes in c. gloeosporioides.
the corresponding gene showed similarity to oligopeptide transporters of the opt family and was therefore named cgopt <dig>  expression of cgopt <dig> in mycelia was low, and was enhanced by external application of iaa.
aeschynomene produces high levels of indole-3-acetic acid  in axenic cultures and during plant infection.
