through qtl analysis and fine mapping in populations from a cross between kas and a japanese variety ichihime, we identified γ-tmt <dig>  which encodes γ-tocopherol methyltransferase, as a candidate gene responsible for high α-tocopherol concentration in kas.
several nucleotide polymorphisms including two nonsynonymous mutations were found in the coding region of γ-tmt <dig> between ichihime and kas, but none of which was responsible for the difference in α-tocopherol concentration.
the genetic variation in γ-tmt <dig>  which plays a major role in determining α-tocopherol concentration, provides significant information about the regulation of tocopherol biosynthesis in soybean seeds.
several efforts have been conducted to improve the α-tocopherol content in soybean  through transgenic technology by overexpressing genes related to α-tocopherol biosynthesis or through changes to crop management practices.
this knowledge will help breeding programs to develop new soybean varieties with high α-tocopherol content.
the expression level of γ-tmt <dig> was higher both in developing seeds and leaves of plants homozygous for the γ-tmt <dig> allele from kas.
the higher expression level was closely correlated with high α-tocopherol content in developing seeds.
improvement of α-tocopherol content is an important breeding aim to increase the nutritional value of crops.
varieties with high α-tocopherol content have been identified in soybean germplasms.
in this study, the genetic mechanism of the high α-tocopherol content trait of kas was elucidated.
