we test the relative importance of these mechanisms in an endemic radiation of rhagada land snails in the dampier archipelago, a continental archipelago off the coast of western australia, where ten morphospecies have complex, overlapping distributions.
we obtained partial mtdna sequence  for  <dig> snails collected from  <dig> locations across  <dig> islands, and used bayesian phylogenetic analysis and analysis of molecular variance  to determine whether geography or the morphological taxonomy best explains the pattern of molecular evolution.
rather than forming distinct monophyletic groups, as would be expected if they had single, independent origins, all of the widely distributed morphospecies were polyphyletic, distributed among several well-supported clades, each of which included several morphospecies.
amova revealed further incongruence between mtdna diversity and morphological variation within clades, as the taxonomic hypothesis always explained a low or non-significant proportion of the molecular variation.
in island archipelagos, where islands have experienced repeated periods of fragmentation and connection through cyclic changes in sea level, complex among-island distributions might reflect historical distributional changes or local evolution.
despite opportunities for distributional changes during periods when the islands were connected, there is no evidence that dispersal has contributed to the geographic variation of shell form at the broad scale.
the distribution of morphotypes among clades and distant islands is explained most simply by their parallel evolution.
each mitochondrial clade had a clear, cohesive geographic distribution, together forming a series of parapatric replacements separated by narrow contact zones.
