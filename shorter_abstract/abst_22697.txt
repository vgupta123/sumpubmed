atnup <dig> promoter activity was detected in many organs, and particularly in the embryo sac, young germinating seedlings and at the adult stage in stipules of cauline leaves.
the plant nuclear pore complex has strongly attracted the attention of the scientific community during the past few years, in particular because of its involvement in hormonal and pathogen/symbiotic signalling.
among these, atnup <dig>  atnup <dig>  atnup <dig>  and attpr have been reported to modulate auxin signalling, since corresponding mutants are suppressors of the auxin resistance conferred by the axr <dig>  mutation.
in arabidopsis thaliana, more than  <dig> nucleoporins have been identified, but only a few of them have been characterized.
this protein is one of the three nucleoporins  of the central channel of the nuclear pore complex.
the atnup62- <dig> mutant, harbouring a t-dna insertion in intron  <dig>  was identified as a knock-down mutant.
the effect of atnup <dig> on auxin signalling likely occurs in relation to scaffold proteins of the nuclear pore complex .
