furthermore, in vivo agroinfiltration assays showed that cpk3-or cpk13-derived phosphorylation of a heat shock factor  promotes pdf <dig>  transcriptional activation in the defense response.
this cascade is not involved in the phytohormone-related signaling pathways, but rather directly impacts transcription factors for defense responses.
these results reveal the involvement of two arabidopsis cpks  in the herbivory-induced signaling network via hsfb2a-mediated regulation of the defense-related transcriptional machinery.
ca2+-binding sensory proteins such as ca2+-dependent protein kinases  have been predicted to mediate the signaling following ca2+ influx after insect herbivory.
following insect attack, the cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> mutants showed lower transcript levels of plant defensin gene pdf <dig>  compared to wild-type plants.
