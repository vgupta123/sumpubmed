the evidence of amplitude changes due to roughness surfaces and slip-resistance levels allows to speculate that texture information is slip-resistance dependent at peripheral level.
here, we analyzed the multifiber afferent discharge of one vibrissal nerve during active whisking.
vibrissae movements were induced by electrical stimulation of motor branches of the facial nerve.
as roughness increased, the rms values also increased in almost all cases.
in addition, we observed a better discrimination performance in the retraction phase .
the amplitude of afferent activity was analyzed according to its root mean square value .
we used sandpapers of different grain size as roughness discrimination surfaces and we also consider the change of vibrissal slip-resistance as a way to improve tactile information acquisition.
we found that the change of the vibrissal slip-resistance is a way to improve the roughness discrimination of surfaces.
in particular, we focus on recent evidence of how neurons at different levels of the sensory pathway carry information about tactile stimuli.
the comparisons among experimental situation were quantified by using the information theory.
