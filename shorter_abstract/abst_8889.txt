the interaction between tif1β and hp <dig> is crucial for heterochromatin formation and maintenance.
finally, we found that the phosphorylation of tif1β/ser <dig> is mediated by the pkcδ pathway and is closely linked to cell proliferation.
the modulation of hp1β-tif1β interaction through the phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation of tif1β/ser <dig> may constitute a molecular switch that regulates the expression of particular genes.
this work demonstrates that tif1β is phosphorylated on ser <dig>  the alteration of which is dynamically associated with cell cycle progression and functionally linked to transcriptional regulation.
higher levels of phosphorylated tif1β/ser <dig> may be associated with the expression of key regulatory genes for cell cycle progression and the proliferation of cells.
consistent with possible inhibition of tif1β's corepressor function, the phosphorylation of the ser <dig> residue, which is located near the hp1-interacting pxvxl motif, compromised the formation of tif1β-hp <dig> complex.
as an epigenetic regulator, the transcriptional intermediary factor 1β /kap1/trim28) has been linked to gene expression and chromatin remodeling at specific loci by association with members of the heterochromatin protein  <dig>  family and various other chromatin factors.
