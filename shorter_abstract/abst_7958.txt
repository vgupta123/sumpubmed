this fungal family provides an interesting model to study the evolution of these genes, because it includes economically important pathogenic species such as ceratocystis fimbriata, c. manginecans and c. albifundus, as well as saprophytic species such as huntiella moniliformis, h. omanensis and h. savannae.
in fungi, gh <dig> invertase genes are found in higher copy numbers in the genomes of pathogens when compared to closely related saprophytes, suggesting an association between invertases and ecological strategy.
the publicly available ceratocystidaceae genome sequences, as well as the h. savannae genome sequenced here, allowed for the identification of novel gh32-like sequences.
as an example, the activity of a fot5-like element likely facilitated the assembly of the genomic regions harbouring the gh <dig> family genes in ceratocystis.
the de novo assembly of the h. savannae draft genome consisted of  <dig>  megabases that coded for  <dig>  <dig> putative genes of which one represented a gh <dig> family member.
our findings suggest that transposable elements shaped the evolution of the gh <dig> gene family, which in turn determines the sucrolytic activities and related ecological strategies of the ceratocystidaceae species that harbour them.
this study provides insight into the evolutionary history of the gh <dig> gene family in ceratocystidaceae.
