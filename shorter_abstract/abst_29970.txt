in hanwoo,  <dig> genes were located in common rohs between whole-genome resequencing and snp chips in bta <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> coincided with quantitative trait loci for meat fat traits.
of  <dig>  million genetic differences in hanwoo, approximately  <dig>  non-synonymous snps, splice-site variants, and coding indels  were detected in  <dig>  genes.
approximately  <dig>  non-synonymous snps, splice-site variants, and coding indels  were detected in  <dig>  genes.
since  <dig>  hanwoo has been bred as beef cattle.
genetic variation was analyzed by whole-genome deep resequencing of a hanwoo bull.
the hanwoo bull genome was sequenced to  <dig> -fold coverage using the abi solid system.
we identified  <dig>  million snps and  <dig>  million small indels by whole-genome resequencing of a hanwoo bull.
the overall genotype concordance between the snps and bovinesnp <dig> beadchip data was  <dig> %.
the hanwoo genome was compared to that of two other breeds, black angus and holstein, and genes within regions of homozygosity were investigated to elucidate the genetic and genomic characteristics of hanwoo.
in addition, the common rohs in bta <dig> and  <dig> were in agreement between hanwoo and black angus.
in total,  <dig>  million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and  <dig>  million small indels were identified by comparison with the btau <dig>  reference assembly.
hanwoo , which originated from natural crossbreeding between taurine and zebu cattle, migrated to the korean peninsula through north china.
‘regulation of actin filament length’ was revealed as a significant gene ontology term and  <dig> trait-associated genes for meat quality and disease resistance were found in  <dig> genes that resided in the rohs of hanwoo.
additionally, we found  <dig> trait-associated genes for meat quality and disease resistance among  <dig> genes that resided in the rohs of hanwoo.
moreover,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> regions of homozygosity  were detected in hanwoo, black angus, and holstein, respectively.
among  <dig>  genes containing reliable specific ns/ss/is in hanwoo,  <dig> genes contained more than one novel damaging ns/ss/i.
these findings will provide useful genomic information for identifying genes or casual mutations associated with economically important traits in cattle.
