plant–parasitic nematodes  are obligate parasites that feed on the roots of living host plants.
we sequenced the soybean root transcriptome at  <dig> and  <dig> days upon independent inoculation with a virulent and avirulent scn population.
when it comes to wreaking havoc on agricultural yield, few nematodes can compare to the soybean cyst nematode .

our results reveal a set of soybean tfbss which are over–represented solely throughout a resistant and susceptible scn reaction.
to explore magnitude of tfbs representation during scn pathogenesis, a multivariate statistical software identified  <dig> over–represented tfbss which capture soybean regulatory dynamics across both reactions.
quantifying soybean  transcription factor binding sites  during a late–stage scn resistant and susceptible reaction can shed light onto the systematic interplay between host and pathogen, thereby elucidating underlying cis–regulatory mechanisms.
genes such as β– <dig>  glucanase, chalcone synthase, superoxide dismutase and various heat shock proteins  exhibited reaction–specific expression profiles.
