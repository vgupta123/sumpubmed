exercise and environmental enrichment re-increase proliferation of ng2+ cells in pd models, however, a possible mechanistic role of dopamine for this increase is not completely understood.
ng2+ cells can differentiate into oligodendrocytes but also into microglia and neurons as observed in vitro suggesting a possible hint for endogenous regenerative capacity of the sn.
proliferation of these cells is altered in animal models of parkinsonâ€™s disease .
we investigated the role of dopamine in ng2-generation and differentiation in the adult sn stimulated by physical activity and environmental enrichment.
we used the 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine -model for dopamine depletion and analysed newborn cells in the sn at different maturation stages and time points depending on voluntary physical activity, enriched environment and levodopa-treatment.
we describe an activity- induced increase of new ng2-positive cells and also mature oligodendrocytes in the sn of healthy mice.
within the adult sn as a non-neurogenic region, cells with mainly oligodendrocytic precursor characteristics, expressing the neuro-glial antigen- <dig>  are continuously generated.
