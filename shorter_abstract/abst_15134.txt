we analyzed the dynamics of this feedback to understand whether post-translational regulation provides any advantages over transcriptional regulation in regard to disturbance rejection.
however, for better disturbance rejection, the p53- mdm <dig> negative feedback has to pay a price of higher stochastic noise.

due to its critical functions, the level of p <dig> is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism to increase its tolerance towards fluctuations and disturbances.
interestingly, the p <dig> level is controlled by post-translational regulation rather than transcriptional regulation in this feedback mechanism.
the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> plays important roles in dna damage repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
feedback control and adaptive estimation theories revealed that post-translational regulation achieves a better trade-off than transcriptional regulation, contributing to a more steady level of p <dig> under the influence of noise and disturbances.
furthermore, post-translational regulation enables cells to respond more promptly to stress conditions with consistent amplitude.
therefore, the system needs to balance the trade-off between steady-state and transient errors.
when a disturbance happens, even though negative feedback reduces the steady-state error, it can cause a system to become less stable and transiently overshoots, which may erroneously trigger downstream reactions.
