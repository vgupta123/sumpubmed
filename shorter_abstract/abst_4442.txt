here we present the rice te database  - a genus-wide collection of transposable elements and repeated sequences across  <dig> diploid species of the genus oryza and the closely-related out-group leersia perrieri.
this is the first report of a repeat dataset that spans the majority of repeat variability within an entire genus, and one that includes complete elements as well as unassembled repeats.
comparative evolutionary analysis of whole genomes requires not only accurate annotation of gene space, but also proper annotation of the repetitive fraction which is often the largest component of most if not all genomes larger than 50Â kb in size.
