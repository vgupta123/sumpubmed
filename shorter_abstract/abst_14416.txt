all groups eventually acquired the response and discriminated the active lever from the inactive lever to some degree.
acbc-lesioned rats were more sensitive to differences in reinforcer magnitude than sham-operated controls, suggesting that the deficit in self-controlled choice previously observed in such rats was a consequence of reduced preference for delayed rewards relative to immediate rewards, not of reduced preference for large rewards relative to small rewards.
we investigated the role of the acbc in learning a free-operant instrumental response using delayed reinforcement, performance of a previously-learned response for delayed reinforcement, and assessment of the relative magnitudes of two different rewards.
acbc lesions did not hinder learning in the absence of delays, but acbc-lesioned rats were impaired in learning when there was a delay, relative to sham-operated controls.
acbc lesions also impaired the performance of a previously-learned instrumental response in a delay-dependent fashion.
these results demonstrate that the acbc contributes to instrumental learning and performance by bridging delays between subjects' actions and the ensuing outcomes that reinforce behaviour.
groups of rats with excitotoxic or sham lesions of the acbc acquired an instrumental response with different delays  between the lever-press response and reinforcer delivery.
as expected, the delays retarded learning in normal rats.
