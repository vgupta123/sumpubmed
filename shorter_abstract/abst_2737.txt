future work will have to establish how useful this new perspective on predicting the effect of nssnps will be in combination with other methods.
this discriminative power was particularly unexpected given the enormous structural variability of pentamers.
local structural change can be predicted.
here, we compare pairs of pentamers  that locally change protein three-dimensional structure  to those that do not alter structure .
