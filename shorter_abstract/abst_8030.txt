principal component analysis revealed a significant clustering of the mediterranean samples into north african and south european groups consistent with the results from the hierarchical amova, which showed a low but significant differentiation between groups from the two shores.
analyses were carried out on a diverse set of neutral and functional polymorphisms located in and around the coagulation factor vii and xii genomic regions .
as there is no consensus between the two genomic regions regarding gene flow through the sahara, it is hard to reach a solid conclusion about its role in the differentiation between the two mediterranean shores and more data are necessary to reach a definite conclusion.
to further investigate this differentiation, we carried out haplotype analyses, which provided partial evidence that sub-saharan gene flow was higher towards north africa than south europe.
however our data suggest that the mediterranean sea was at least partially a barrier to gene flow between the two shores.
for the same range of geographic distances, populations from each side of the mediterranean were found to differ genetically more than populations within the same side.
in this study, we investigate the genetic relationships among thirteen population samples from the broader mediterranean region together with three other groups from the ivory coast and bolivia with a particular focus on the genetic structure between north africa and south europe.
