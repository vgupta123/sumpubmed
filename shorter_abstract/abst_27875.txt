in addition, all genes versus keywords were hierarchical clustered to reveal a complete grouping of published genes based on co-occurrence.
receiver operator characteristics  analyses showed that most gene sets were clustered much better than expected by random chance.
to test grouping of genes from real microarray data,  <dig> differentially expressed genes from a microarray experiment were analyzed with copub mapper, which resulted in several relevant clusters of genes with biological process and disease keywords.
the copub mapper program allows for quick and versatile querying of co-published genes and keywords and can be successfully used to cluster predefined groups of genes and microarray data.
in order to identify biological similarities between genes, publications from medline were identified in which pairs of gene names and combinations of gene name with specific keywords were co-mentioned.
high throughput microarray analyses result in many differentially expressed genes that are potentially responsible for the biological process of interest.
pubmed ids were retrieved from medline and relative probability of co-occurrences of all gene-gene and gene-keyword pairs determined.
