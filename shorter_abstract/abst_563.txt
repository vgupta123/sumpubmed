conditions that enhanced sox4-plakoglobin interactions resulted in reduced transcriptional activity of Î²-catenin luciferase reporters.
these data suggest that this newly identified interaction between sox <dig> and plakoglobin is inhibitory and provides new insights into the role of sox <dig> in key pathways in cell proliferation, development, and cancer progression.
here, we have adapted a one-step affinity purification method that enables rapid purification of sox <dig> complexes via intracellular biotinylation of the amino-terminus of sox <dig> to perform large-scale proteomics analysis.
sox <dig> is overexpressed in many human malignancies, but the precise role of sox <dig> in cancer progression is still not well understood.
thus, the identification of additional sox <dig> binding partners is essential for elucidating the mechanism of sox4-mediated effects in cancer progression.
