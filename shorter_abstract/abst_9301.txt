xenavidin was identified from an est sequence database for xenopus tropicalis and produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system.
biacore sensor analysis, fluorescently labelled biotin and radioactive biotin were used to evaluate the biotin-binding properties of xenavidin - it binds biotin with high affinity though less tightly than do chicken avidin and bacterial streptavidin.
here we structurally and functionally characterise a novel avidin named xenavidin, which is to our knowledge the first reported avidin from a frog.
avidins are proteins with extraordinarily high ligand-binding affinity, a property which is used in a wide array of life science applications.
the location of structural water molecules at the entrance and/or within the ligand-binding site may have a role in determining the characteristic biotin-binding properties of xenavidin.
the recombinant xenavidin was found to be homotetrameric based on gel filtration analysis.
