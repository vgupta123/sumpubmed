kidney samples were collected from  <dig> dog and  <dig> cat cadavers donated by the owners to the veterinary teaching hospital of the university of padua and standardized ultrasonographic images of each sample were collected.
statistical analysis to evaluate the influence of histological lesions on mgv was performed.
the global influence of histological lesions on renal echogenicity was higher in cats  than in dogs .
statistical analysis revealed that only glomerulosclerosis was an independent determinant of echogenicity in dogs whereas interstitial nephritis, interstitial necrosis and fibrosis were independent determinants of echogenicity in cats.
increased cortical or cortical and medullary echogenicity is one of the most common signs of chronic or acute kidney disease in dogs and cats.
the echogenicity of the renal cortex was quantitatively assessed by means of mean gray value , and then histopathological analysis was performed.

the differentiation efficiency of mgv to detect pathological changes in the kidneys was calculated for dogs and cats.
moreover, mgv is a poor test for distinguishing between normal and pathological kidneys in the dog with a sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> %.
the aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between histopathology and ex-vivo renal cortical echogenicity in dogs and cats devoid of any patient and technical-related biases.
patient and technical-related factors affect in-vivo quantitative evaluation of the echogenicity of parenchymal organs.
instead, it seems to perform globally better in the cat, resulting in a fair test, with a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of 56%.
