this approach provides more accurate information regarding the rate of protein synthesis, and identifies some mosquito factors that might have gone unrecognized because expression of these proteins is regulated mainly at the translational level rather than at the transcriptional level after mosquitoes ingest a plasmodium-infected blood meal.
malaria parasites in the midgut are surrounded by a hostile environment rich in digestive enzymes, while a rapidly responding immune system recognizes plasmodium ookinetes and recruits killing factors from the midgut and surrounding tissues, dramatically reducing the population of invading ookinetes before they can successfully traverse the midgut epithelium.
understanding molecular details of the parasite-vector interactions requires precise measurement of nascent protein synthesis in the mosquito during plasmodium infection.
caspar, a negative regulator of the nf-kappab transcription factor rel <dig>  appears to be substantially activated at the translational levels during plasmodium infection.
this approach led to identification of  <dig> mosquito transcripts that were primarily regulated at the translational level after ingestion of plasmodium falciparum-infected blood.
in this study, we used sucrose density gradient centrifugation to isolate actively translating anopheles gambiae mrnas based upon their association with polyribosomes .
malaria is caused by plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted via the bites of infected anopheline mosquitoes.
midgut invasion is a major bottleneck for plasmodium development inside the mosquito vectors.
