we report on the crna target synthesis, labeling efficiency and hybridization results using the one-cycle target labeling assay™ , the bioarray rna amplification and labeling system™ , and the superscript rna amplification system .
however, there have been no evaluations of these different kits to determine if comparable results were generated.
these  <dig> one-cycle labeling kits produce comparable hybridization results.
several different commercial one-cycle labeling kits are available for preparation of the target for use with the affymetrix genechip platform.
however, each kit resulted in comparable signal and detection calls when hybridized to the affymetrix genechip.
the only notable difference between kits was in the yield of crna target synthesized during in vitro transcription, where the bioarray assay had to be repeated several times in order to have sufficient target.
