a significant correlation  was observed between cd <dig> expression patterns and epidermal ulceration.
highly significant  correlations were also established between the two cellular proliferation markers and histological grade, tumour necrosis and epidermal ulceration.
several prognosis tools have been proposed for canine mast cell tumours, including histological grading and cell proliferation markers.
highly significant  correlations were found between cd <dig> immunostaining patterns and histological grade, cell proliferation markers  and tumoral necrosis.
these findings highlight the key role of cd <dig> in the biopathology of canine mcts and confirm the relationship between aberrant cd <dig> expression and increased cell proliferation and higher histological grade.
cytoplasmic cd <dig> expression has been found to correlate with higher histological grade and with a worsened post-surgical prognosis.
this study addresses the role of cd <dig> in canine mast cell tumours by studying the correlations between cd <dig> immunoexpression patterns, two proliferation markers  histological grade, and several other pathological variables.
cutaneous mast cell tumours are one of the most common neoplasms in dogs and show a highly variable biologic behaviour.
further studies are needed to unravel the cellular mechanisms underlying focal and diffuse cytoplasmic cd <dig> staining patterns, and their respective biopathologic relevance.
