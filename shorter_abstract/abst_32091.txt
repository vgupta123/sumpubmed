a protocol for tracking the expression of individual c. elegans genes was developed that collects image samples of a developing embryo by 3-d time lapse microscopy.
in this protocol, a program called starrynite performs the automatic recognition of fluorescently labeled cells and traces their lineage.
a new version of starrynite that includes the trained svm classifier is available at http://starrynite.sourceforge.net.
image analysis is an essential component in many biological experiments that study gene expression, cell cycle progression, and protein localization.
