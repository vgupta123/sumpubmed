in this study, we comprehensively analyzed the properties of genes regulated by ecs  and found mirna targets were significantly enriched among the ec-genes.
compared with the non-mirna-targets, mirna targets were roughly twice as likely to be ec-genes.
by investigating the collection methods and other properties of the ec-genes, we demonstrated that the enrichment of mirna targets was not attributed to either the potential collection bias of ec-genes, the presence of paralogs, longer 3'utrs or more conserved 3'utrs.
in each module, mirnas and ecs were closely connected, providing a good method to design accurate mirna markers for ecs in toxicology research.
recent disease research showed the exposure to some environmental chemicals  can regulate the expression patterns of mirnas, which raises the intriguing question of how mirnas and their targets cope with the exposure to ecs throughout the genome.
this association network of mirnas-ecs was highly modular and could be separated into  <dig> interconnected modules.
