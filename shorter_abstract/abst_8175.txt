of the  <dig> taxa identified to the level of a linnaean species name,  <dig>  corresponded to a single motu, four  represented closely related sibling species pairs within a single motu, and ten  were divided into two or more motus suggestive of cryptic species.
we employed dna barcoding to provide estimates of provisional species diversity, including for families currently lacking taxonomic expertise, and to examine the guild structure, habitat distribution, and biogeography of beetles in the churchill region.
we obtained dna barcodes from  <dig> specimens representing  <dig> species or provisional species  in  <dig> families of coleoptera.
we conducted an intensive biodiversity survey from 2006â€“ <dig> at churchill, manitoba, canada in order to quantify beetle species diversity in this model region, and to prepare a barcode library of beetles for sub-arctic biodiversity and ecological research.
coleoptera is the most diverse order of insects , but its richness diminishes at increasing latitudes , particularly of phytophagous and detritivorous species.

forest habitats, particularly dry boreal forest, although limited in extent in the region, were undersampled.
most named species of carabidae and dytiscidae showed a significant bias toward open habitats .
