the average length of the identified cnvrs was 19 kb , with shorter cnvrs being more frequent than longer cnvrs.
the total length of all cnvrs was  <dig> mbps, which equates to  <dig>  % of the sheep autosomes.
comprehensive information from small pedigrees  was collected using multiple platforms , with these data then analysed via multiple approaches to identify and verify cnvs.
cnvs identified on the roche-nimblegen  <dig> m cgh array generally had low validation rates with lower density arrays, while whole genome sequence data had the highest validation rate .
the characteristics of the  <dig>  autosomal cnv regions identified in this study are comparable to other cnv regions reported in the literature and provide a valuable and sizeable addition to the small subset of published sheep cnvs.
in total,  <dig>  autosomal cnv regions  were identified in this study, which substantially builds on an initial survey of the sheep genome that identified  <dig> cnvrs.
copy number variants  are a type of polymorphism found to underlie phenotypic variation, both in humans and livestock.

most surveys of cnv in livestock have been conducted in the cattle genome, and often utilise only a single approach for the detection of copy number differences.
multiple approaches were used to detect cnv regions and it appears that the best method for verifying cnvr on a large scale involves using a combination of detection methodologies.
here we performed a study of cnv in sheep, using multiple methods to identify and characterise copy number changes.
