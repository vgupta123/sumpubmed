here, we show that pooling genetically diverse breeding lines according to a contrasting phenotype also allows high resolution mapping of the causal gene in a crop species.
we determined the allele frequencies of polymorphic sequences using sequence data from two diverging phenotypic pools of  <dig> b. vulgaris accessions each.
our approach made it possible to identify a small interval around the causative gene.
a single interval of about  <dig> kbp among the nine chromosomes was identified which indeed contained the causative mutation.

the combination of bulk segregant analysis  and next generation sequencing , also known as mapping by sequencing , has been shown to significantly accelerate the identification of causal mutations for species with a reference genome sequence.
