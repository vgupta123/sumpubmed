the electron micrographs revealed a uniform intracellular distribution of ag-np both in cytoplasm and nucleus.
there was efficient recovery from arrest in normal human fibroblasts whereas the cancer cells ceased to proliferate.
our results suggest that cancer cells are susceptible to damage with lack of recovery from ag-np-induced stress.
silver nanoparticles  are among the most commercialised nanoparticles due to their antimicrobial potential.
ag-np is found to be acting through intracellular calcium transients and chromosomal aberrations, either directly or through activation of catabolic enzymes.
