the gc b-cells proliferate rapidly and undergo selection and affinity maturation.
the gene expression study of normal b-cell compartments may additionally contribute to our understanding of the molecular abnormalities of the corresponding lymphoid tumors.
there are three major b-cell compartments in peripheral lymphoid organs: the germinal center , the mantle zone  and the marginal zone .
the mgz was characterized by high expression of many chemokines genes e.g.
a stromal signature was identified including genes associated with macrophages or with synthesis of extracellular matrix and genes that influenced lymphocyte migration and survival.
the transcriptional program of the gc was dominated by upregulation of genes associated with proliferation and dna repair or recombination.
the adult splenic mgz contains mostly memory b cells and is also known to provide a rapid response to particulate antigens.
cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ifn-associated genes, consistent with its role in rapid response to infections.
we performed laser microdissection of the three compartments for gene expression profiling by cdna microarray.
mnz b cells are na√Øve cells in a quiescent state and may participate in gc reactions upon proper stimulation.
transcriptional profiling of b-cell compartments has identified groups of genes involved in critical molecular and cellular events that affect proliferation, survival migration, and differentiation of the cells.
