a number of dna fragmentation methods, such as hydrodynamic sharing, sonication or dnase i fragmentation, have various drawbacks, including dna damage, poor fragmentation control, irreproducibility and non-overlapping dna segment representation.
enzyme family, can be chemically relaxed by a cofactor analogue, allowing it to recognize very short dna sequences of 3-bp combined frequency.
family bifunctional enzyme exhibiting cofactor analogue specificity relaxation.
genomics and metagenomics are currently leading research areas, with dna sequences accumulating at an exponential rate.
this phenomenon, employed under partial digestion conditions, was applied to quasi-random dna fragmentation.
in the presence of sin/dmso, taqii rease is transformed from cleaving every 4096 bp on average to cleaving every 58 bp.
we constructed a horse genomic library and a deletion derivative library of the butyrylcholinesterase cdna coding region using a novel method, based on taqii, thermus sp.
we have shown previously that class-iis/iic/iig tspgwi rease, the prototype member of the thermus sp.
because partial dna cleavage is an inherent feature of the thermus sp.
