the chemical property and biological function of a protein is a direct consequence of its primary structure.
we present a method based on spectral similarity to compare subsequences of amino acids that behave similarly but are not aligned well by considering amino acids as mere characters.
this approach finds a similarity score between sequences based on any given attribute, like hydrophobicity of amino acids, on the basis of spectral information after partial conversion to the frequency domain.
distance matrices of various branches of the human kinome, that is the full complement of human kinases, were developed that matched the phylogenetic tree of the human kinome establishing the efficacy of the global alignment of the algorithm.
the method captures subsequences that do not align by traditional character based alignment tools but give rise to similar secondary and tertiary structures.
the spectral similarity score  is an extension to the conventional similarity methods and results indicate that it holds a strong potential for analysis of various biological sequences and structural variations in proteins.
however, character based similarity cannot provide insight into the structural aspects of a protein.
