this study shows that the %g+c profiling and fractioning prior to cloning and sequencing can reveal a significantly larger proportion of high g+c content bacteria within the clones recovered, compared with the unfractioned sample in the human gi tract.
the human gastrointestinal  tract microbiota is characterised by an abundance of uncultured bacteria most often assigned in phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes.
a phylogenetic analysis of the composition of the human gi microbiota of  <dig> healthy adult subjects was performed from a pooled faecal bacterial dna sample by combining genomic %g+c -based profiling and fractioning with 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing.
the most important finding was that the proportional amount of sequences affiliating with the phylum actinobacteria was  <dig> % in the %g+c fractioned sample but only  <dig> % in the unfractioned sample.
especially the order coriobacteriales within the phylum actinobacteria was found to be more abundant than previously estimated with conventional sequencing studies.
the main purpose of this work was to study whether the genomic percent guanine and cytosine  -based profiling and fractioning prior to 16s rrna gene sequence analysis reveal higher microbiota diversity, especially with high g+c bacteria suggested to be underrepresented in previous studies.
a total of  <dig> partial 16s rrna genes were sequenced.
