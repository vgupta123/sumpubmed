in the present work, we identified, cloned and characterized ultrapetala transcription factor called csult <dig> from crocus.
our results suggest that csult <dig> is a novel regulator of crocus apocarotenoid biosynthesis.
although the biosynthetic pathway of apocarotenoids is known to a considerable extent, the mechanism that regulates its tissue and developmental stage specific expression is not known.
the csult <dig> transcript was more abundant in stigma and showed increase in expression from pre anthesis stage till anthesis and decreased in post anthesis stage which corroborated with the accumulation pattern of crocin indicating its possible role in regulation of apocarotenoid biosynthesis.
overexpression of csult <dig> in crocus calli resulted in enhanced expression of key pathway genes like phytoene synthase , phytoene desaturase , beta carotene hydroxylase  and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases  indicating its role in regulation of apocarotenoid biosynthesis.
crocus sativus is a triploid sterile plant with long red stigmas which form commercial saffron.
the gene contains an  <dig> amino acid long conserved sand domain.
we show for the first time involvement of plant sand domain proteins in regulating secondary metabolic pathways.
its expression is induced in response to phytohormones like auxin, methyljasmonate and salicylic acid.
