in order to build h-cores, we present a new spiral search algorithm based on tabu-guided local search.
the experimental results show that our spiral search algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art local search algorithms for simplified protein structure prediction.
for hp energy model, developing a compact hydrophobic-core  is essential for the progress of the search.
our algorithm uses a novel h-core directed guidance heuristic that squeezes the structure around a dynamic hydrophobic-core centre.
we also used a novel relay-restart technique to handle stagnation.
protein structure prediction is an important but unsolved problem in biological science.
in our simplified ab initio protein structure prediction methods, we use hydrophobic-polar  energy model for structure evaluation, and 3-dimensional face-centred-cubic lattice for structure mapping.
