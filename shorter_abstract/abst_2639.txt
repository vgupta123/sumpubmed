cells that internalize during gastrulation show apical contractile flows, which are correlated with centripetal extensions from surrounding cells.
the combination of coplanar division-based spreading and recurrent local modules for piecemeal internalization constitutes a system-level solution of gradual volume rearrangement under spatial constraint.
we report a modular structure of cell internalization in caenorhabditis elegans gastrulation that reveals mechanisms of self-organization.
despite the conservation of gastrulation as a key event in metazoan embryogenesis, the morphogenetic mechanisms of self-organization  are poorly understood.
our results suggest that the mode of c. elegans gastrulation can be unified with the general notions of monolayer remodeling and with distinct cellular mechanisms of actomyosin-based morphogenesis.
we further report that this self-organizing module can adapt to severe topological alterations, providing evidence of scalability and plasticity of actomyosin-based patterning.
