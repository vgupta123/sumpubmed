transcriptional mechanisms that delay endonuclease expression have been identified in some rm systems.
in c-controlled rm systems, there is a Â±  <dig> nt overlap between the c termination codon and the r  initiation codon, suggesting possible translational coupling, and in many cases predicted rna hairpins could occlude the ribosome binding site for the endonuclease gene.
when rm genes enter a new cell, methylation must occur before restriction activity appears, or the host's chromosome is digested.
in contrast, a frameshift mutation in pvuiic decreased expression markedly in both fusions, but mrna measurements indicated that this decrease could be explained by transcriptional polarity.
thus, at least during balanced growth, transcriptional control appears to be sufficiently robust for proper regulation of this rm system.
this regulation results in very low r.pvuii mrna levels early after gene entry, followed by rapid increase due to positive feedback.
expression levels of lacz translational fusions to pvuiir or pvuiic were determined, with the native pvuii promoter having been replaced by one not controlled by c.pvuii.
a substantial subset of those systems is controlled by a family of small transcription activators called c proteins.
expression of pvuiir-lacz was unaffected when the pvuiic stop codon was moved  <dig> nt downstream from its wt location, or  <dig> or  <dig> bp upstream of the pvuiir initiation codon.
