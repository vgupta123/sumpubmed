this study indicates that slsr expression is influenced by both the rin-mediated developmental network and ethylene signaling.
to study the possible roles of this gene family in fruit development and ripening, we cloned seven sr/camtas, designated as slsrs, from tomato, a model fruit-bearing crop.
all slsrs were highly yet differentially expressed during fruit development and ripening.
most notably, the expression of slsr <dig> was scarcely detected at the mature green and breaker stages, two critical stages of fruit development and ripening; and slsr3l and slsr <dig> were expressed exclusively in fruit tissues.
the results suggest that calcium signaling is involved in the regulation of fruit development and ripening through calcium/calmodulin/slsr interactions.
by contrast, only minor alterations were noted for ripening mutant nor and nr fruit.
however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.
in addition, ethylene treatment of mature green wildtype fruit transiently stimulated expression of all slsrs within one to two hours.
during the developmental span from  <dig> to  <dig> days post anthesis, the expression profiles of all seven slsrs were dramatically altered in ripening mutant rin compared with wildtype fruit.
