there is a greater potential to study the native endophytic plant beneficial bacteria for developing them as biocontrol agents against human pathogens that are harboured by plants.
the bacterial isolates were identified by growth in selective media, biochemical tests and 16s rrna gene sequencing.
out of the  <dig> isolates,  <dig> % are human pathogens and  <dig> % are human opportunistic pathogens.
existence of a high population of plant beneficial bacteria was found to have suppressed the population of plant and human pathogens.
vegetable samples were collected from markets of two vegetable hot spot growing areas, during two different crop harvest seasons.
human opportunistic pathogens were predominant in carrot and onion, whereas plant beneficial bacteria dominated in cucumber and tomato.
the study aimed at enumerating, identifying and categorizing the endophytic cultivable bacterial community in selected salad vegetables .
crude and diluted vegetable extracts were plated and the population of endophytic bacteria was assessed based on morphologically distinguishable colonies.
bacterial isolates belonged to  <dig> classes covering  <dig> distinct species belonging to  <dig> genera.
the endophytic population was found to be comparably higher in cucumber and tomato in both of the sampling locations, whereas lower in carrot and onion.
