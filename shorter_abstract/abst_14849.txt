appropriate regulation of respective gene expressions is a bottleneck for the realization of artificial biological systems inside living cells.
the modification of several promoter sequences is required to achieve appropriate regulation of the systems.
moreover, by assembling two different operator parts on the regulatory region, we constructed a regulatory device with an and gate function.
we implemented a new standard to assemble operator parts for construction of functional genetic logic gates.
by standardizing the regulatory region of a plasmid and the operator parts, we established a platform for modular assembly of the operator parts.
the logic gates at the molecular scale have important implications for reprogramming cellular behavior.
we developed a standardized method for integrating operator sequences to the regulatory region of a plasmid and constructed a synthetic promoter that functions as a genetic and gate.
however, a time-consuming process is required for the insertion of an operator, a binding site of a protein for gene expression, to the gene regulatory region of a plasmid.
thus, a standardized method for integrating operator sequences to the regulatory region of a plasmid is required.
