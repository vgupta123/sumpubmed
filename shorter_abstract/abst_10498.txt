it can be used to improve the root resistance or tolerance to pathogens, pests, malnutrition and other abiotic stresses which cause extensive annual losses in soybean production.
inducible promoters are activated by specific inducers.
the gmprp2p- <dig> and its 5’-deletion fragments were fused with the gus reporter gene and introduced into arabidopsis and the hairy roots of soybean to further determine promoter activity.
histochemical analysis in transgenic arabidopsis showed that gus activity was mainly detected in roots and hypocotyls in all deletion fragments except gmprp2p- <dig> .
tissue-specific promoters are a type of specific promoters that drive gene expression in specific tissues or organs.
constitutive promoters are widely used in genetic engineering, but these promoters have limitations.
gmprp2p- <dig> is a root-preferential promoter, and its core fragment for root-preferential expression might lie between − <dig> and + <dig>  gmprp2p- <dig> may be useful in the genetic engineering of novel soybean cultivars in the future.
the expression pattern indicated that this promoter is root-preferential in transgenic arabidopsis and the hairy roots of soybean.
gus activity was higher in transgenic arabidopsis and hairy roots with gmprp2p- <dig> and gmprp2p- <dig>  constructs than the other two constructs.
gus activity was enhanced by nacl, peg, iaa and jm treatments and decreased by sa, aba and ga treatments in transgenic arabidopsis.
promoters play important roles in gene expression and function.
