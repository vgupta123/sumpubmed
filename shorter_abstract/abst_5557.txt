two-thirds of these complexes are randomly selected to train a predictive model of binding affinity as follows: two tessellations are generated in each case, one for the entire complex and another strictly for the isolated protein without its bound ligand, and a topological score is computed for each tessellation with the four-body potential.
next, we identify a second, independent set of three hundred protein-ligand complexes, having both high-resolution structures and known dissociation constants.
here, we begin by applying the computational geometry technique of delaunay tessellation to each set of atomic coordinates for over  <dig> diverse macromolecular structures, for the purpose of deriving a four-body statistical potential that serves as a topological scoring function.
applying our model to an independent test set of high-resolution structures for three hundred diverse enzyme-inhibitor complexes, each with an experimentally known inhibition constant, also yields a correlation of r =  <dig>   between experimental and calculated binding energies.
lastly, we generate predictions with our model on a diverse test set of one hundred protein-ligand complexes previously used to benchmark  <dig> related methods, and our correlation of r =  <dig>  between the calculated and experimental binding energies for this dataset exceeds those of the other approaches.
models that are capable of reliably predicting binding affinities for protein-ligand complexes play an important role the field of structure-guided drug design.
to validate the method, we similarly generated two tessellations for each of the remaining protein-ligand complexes, computed their topological scores and the difference between the two scores for each complex, and applied the previously derived linear transformation of this topological score difference to predict binding affinities.
predicted protein-ligand binding affinity is then based on an empirically derived linear function of the difference between both topological scores, one that appropriately scales the value of this difference.
