western blotting and growth studies in rich and iron-depleted media demonstrated that protein expression from these plasmids was under iron control.
bidirectional protein expression in an iron-deprived pfcf2-enta transformant was confirmed using antibiotic selection, cas assays and growth studies.
in the presence of intracellular iron, protein expression from these constructs was abrogated due to fur repression.

in the e. coli chromosome, there is a bidirectional intercistronic promoter region with two non-overlapping fur boxes.
we cloned the e. coli bidirectional fepb/entc promoter region into low-copy-number plasmid backbones  along with downstream sequences encoding epitope tags and a multiple cloning site  compatible with the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid  system.
the vectors pfcf <dig>  pfcf <dig>  and pfbh <dig> have been shown to use the fepb/entc promoter region to control bidirectional in trans expression of epitope-tagged proteins in iron-depleted transformants.
we showed that e. coli knockout strains transformed with pfcf1-enta, pfcf1-ente and pfbh1-entb express corresponding proteins with appropriate epitope tags when grown under iron restriction.
in the presence of sufficient iron, the escherichia coli protein fur  represses genes controlled by the fur box, a consensus sequence near or within promoters of target genes.
this region controls fur-regulated expression of entcebah in the clockwise direction and fepb in the anticlockwise direction.
