impaired ability to utilize pyruvate and reduced activity of arginine deiminase was observed in 1457Δlytsr, which is consistent with the microarray data.
staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged as one of the most important nosocomial pathogens, mainly because of its ability to colonize implanted biomaterials by forming a biofilm.
extensive studies are focused on the molecular mechanisms involved in biofilm formation.
the lytsr two-component regulatory system regulates autolysis and biofilm formation in staphylococcus aureus.
in addition, lytsr may indirectly enhance biofilm formation by altering the metabolic status of the bacteria.
the preliminary results suggest that in s. epidermidis lytsr two-component system regulates extracellular murein hydrolase activity, bacterial cell death and pyruvate utilization.
microarray analysis showed that lytsr mutation affected the transcription of  <dig> genes .
compared to the wild-type counterpart, 1457Δlytsr produced slightly more biofilm, with significantly decreased dead cells inside.
based on the microarray data, it appears that lytsr inactivation induces a stringent response.
quantitative murein hydrolase assay indicated that disruption of lytsr in s. epidermidis resulted in decreased activities of extracellular murein hydrolases, although zymogram showed no apparent differences in murein hydrolase patterns between s. epidermidis strain  <dig> and its lytsr mutant.
however, the role of lytsr played in s. epidermidis remained unknown.
in the present study, we demonstrated that lytsr knock-out in s. epidermidis did not alter susceptibility to triton x- <dig> induced autolysis.
specifically, genes encoding proteins responsible for protein synthesis, energy metabolism were downregulated, while genes involved in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid transporters were upregulated.
