helitrons are dna transposable elements that are proposed to replicate via a rolling circle mechanism.
non-autonomous helitron elements have captured gene fragments from many genes in maize  but only a handful of genes in arabidopsis .
we performed computational searches to identify helitrons in maize and rice genomic sequence data.
we identified over  <dig> helitrons in the japonica rice genome.
the free energy of folding for maize helitrons were significantly lower than those in rice, but the direction of the difference differed from our prediction.
our total sample of maize helitrons contained fragments of  <dig> captured genes.
maize helitrons are clearly unique relative to those of rice and arabidopsis in the prevalence of gene capture, but the reasons for this difference remain elusive.
maize helitrons do not seem to be more polymorphic among individuals than those of arabidopsis; they do not appear to be substantially older or younger than the helitrons in either species; and our analyses provided little evidence that the 3' hairpin plays a role.
more than 70% of these were found in a collinear location in the indica rice genome, and  <dig> clustered as a single large subfamily.
