our results make the null hypothesis of neutrality of these pepck polymorphisms quite unlikely, but support an alternative hypothesis that they are maintained by natural selection in parallel in the two species.
we study its natural genetic variation in colias .
this case emphasizes the importance, for evolutionary insight, of studying gene-specific mechanisms affected by natural genetic variation as an essential complement to surveys of such variation.
we ask, using coalescent simulations, if these polymorphisms′ cross-species similarities are compatible with neutral evolution by genetic drift, but find the probability of this null hypothesis is  <dig>  ≤ p ≤  <dig>  under differing scenarios.
in two colias species from distinct clades, pepck sequence is highly variable at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, mainly in its common exons.
homology-based structural modelling shows that the variants can alter hydrogen bonding, salt bridging, or van der waals interactions of amino acid side chains, locally or at one another′s sites which are distant in pepck′s structure, and thus may affect its enzyme function.
pepck offers a route, alternative to pyruvate kinase, for carbon skeletons to move between cytosolic glycolysis and mitochondrial krebs cycle reactions.
