array cgh can be used to effectively identify gene duplication and genome content; however, certain biases are present due to sequence divergence and other genome characteristics resulting from the divergence between lineages.
one potent source of genomic variation is gene duplication, which is prevalent among individuals and species.
here, beyond the demonstration that gene duplicates among species can be quantified with acgh, we consider the effect of sequence divergence on the ability to detect gene duplicates.
duplicates that have been retained for a selective advantage due to directional selection acting on many loci in one or both gene copies are likely to be under-represented.
we demonstrate that genome characteristics  can also affect the ability to accurately measure genomic content.
the results of this study should inform the interpretation of both previously published and future work that employs this powerful technique.
we describe a normalization strategy and statistical criteria to be used for the identification of gene duplicates among any species group for which an array platform is available from a closely related species.
highly conserved gene duplicates will be more readily recovered by acgh.
using the x chromosome genomic content difference between male d. melanogaster and female d. yakuba and d. simulans, we describe a decrease in the ability to accurately measure genomic content  for orthologs that are only 90% identical.
