functional categorization of kumquat xcc-responsive genes revealed an enhanced defence-related metabolism as well as a number of resistant response-specific genes in the kumquat transcriptome in response to xcc inoculation.
this study identified components of the incompatible interaction such as reactive oxygen species  and programmed cell death .
our results demonstrate how the use of microarray expression profiling can help assign roles to previously uncharacterized genes and elucidate plant pathogenesis-response related mechanisms.
this can be considered to be a case study in a citrus relative where high throughput technologies were utilized to understand defence mechanisms in fortunella and citrus at the molecular level.
common defence mechanisms and a number of resistance genes were also identified.
this could be an indication of either a specialized set of genes employed by kumquat in response to canker disease or new defence mechanisms in citrus.
these data will be used to perform comparisons among citrus species to evaluate means to enhance the host immune responses against bacterial diseases.
citrus canker disease caused by the bacterial pathogen xanthomonas citri subsp.
in addition, there were a considerable number of differentially regulated genes that had no homologues in the databases.
of  <dig> selected genes on a customized array,  <dig> were differentially expressed  in xcc challenged kumquat plants compared to mock-inoculated ones.
we have developed subtractive libraries enriched in sequences expressed in kumquat leaves during both early and late stages of the disease.
this was done in order to elucidate molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the hypersensitive response phenotype in kumquat leaves.
