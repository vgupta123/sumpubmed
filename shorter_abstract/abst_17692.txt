tandemly repeated dna represents a large portion of the human genome, and accounts for a significant amount of copy number variation.
this study represents the most comprehensive genome wide analysis of large tandem repeats in the human genome, and will serve as an important resource towards understanding the organization and copy number variation of these complex dna families.
several novel megasatellite tandem dna families were observed that are characterized by repeating patterns of interspersed transposable elements that have expanded presumably by unequal crossing over.
using tandem repeats finder , tandem repeat arrays greater than  <dig> kb in total size were identified, and classified into simple sequence e.g.
alpha satellite dna, and locus specific vntr arrays.
using additional methods, we further identified a total of  <dig> additional arrays with tandem repeat units greater than  <dig> kb ,  <dig> of which contained genes or repeated exons.
here we present a genome wide analysis of the largest tandem repeats found in the human genome sequence.
one of these families is found on  <dig> different chromosomes in > <dig> arrays, and represents one of the largest most widespread megasatellite dna families.
analysis of these large sequenced regions revealed that several "simple sequence" arrays actually showed complex domain and/or higher order repeat organization.
