microbial lipases in particular have been widely used in a variety of industrial applications.
finally, the hydrolysis of algal oil by lipm was analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer, thin layer chromatography and gas chromatograph.
when applied for hydrolysis of algal oil, lipm could enrich  <dig>  % polyunsaturated fatty acids, which include  <dig>  % eicosapentaenoic acid,  <dig>  % docosapentaenoic acid, and  <dig>  % docosahexaenoic acid with derivative glycerides containing  <dig>  % diacylglycerols.

<dig> lipases, but also provides an ideal biocatalyst for the enrichment of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
however, the current commercial microbial lipases cannot meet industrial demand due to rapid inactivation under harsh conditions.
cloning of lipm was based on touchdown pcr and genome walking, and then recombinant lipm was purified by guanidine hydrochloride and the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins affinity chromatography.
lipm activity was enhanced by ca2+, sr2+, mn2+, and ba2+, but sharply inhibited by cu2+, zn2+, co2+, ni2+, and edta.
cr- <dig>  lipm was expressed in escherichia coli, purified from inclusion bodies, and further biochemically characterized.
<dig> of lipases, and the predicted amino acid sequences of lipm has 82 % identity to lipase lipt from pseudomonas mandelii jr- <dig>  and 54 % identity to lipase pml from pseudomonas sp.
the lipm gene was first cloned from pseudomonas moraviensis m <dig> via touchdown pcr and genome walking.
