our results confirm that pv- <dig> is preferentially induced in the endothelium of mouse brain tumors and acute ischemic brain tissue and corresponds to blood-brain barrier disruption in a fashion analogous to human patients.
additionally, pv- <dig> is induced in a mouse model of acute ischemia.
we demonstrate that pv- <dig> is selectively upregulated in mouse blood vessels recruited by brain tumor xenografts at the rna and protein levels, but is not detected in non-neoplastic brain.
plasmalemmal vesicle associated protein- <dig>  is selectively expressed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells derived from clinical specimens of primary and secondary malignant brain tumors, cerebral ischemia, and other central nervous system  diseases associated with blood-brain barrier breakdown.
