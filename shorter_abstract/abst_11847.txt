these clones were then utilized in fish experiments on cow metaphase or interphase nuclei in order to disambiguate the discrepancies.
our work demonstrates how fish, which is assembly independent, can be efficiently used to solve assembly problems frequently encountered using the shotgun approach.
inconsistencies were grouped into three main categories:  dna segments showing almost coincidental chromosomal mapping but discordant orientation ;  dna segments showing a discordant map position along the same chromosome; and  sequences present in one chromosomal assembly but absent in the corresponding chromosome of the other assembly.
in almost all instances the fish results agreed with the umd <dig>  assembly.
occasionally, however, the mapping data of both assemblies were discordant with the fish results.
a second, alternate cow genome assembly , based on the same raw sequence data, was also published.
the sequencing of the cow genome was recently published .
