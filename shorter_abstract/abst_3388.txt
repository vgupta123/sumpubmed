stepwise methylation of tricetin involves deprotonation of its hydroxyl groups by a his262-asp <dig> pair followed by nucleophilic attack of sam-methyl groups.
substrate binding is mediated by an extensive network of h-bonds and van der waals interactions.
these successive methylations raised the question as to whether they take place in one, or different active sites.
we constructed a 3-d model of this protein using the crystal structure of the highly homologous medicago sativa caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid o-methyltransferase  as a template with the aim of proposing a mechanism for multiple methyl transfer reactions in wheat.
wheat  o-methyltransferase  catalyzes the sequential methylation of the flavone, tricetin, to its 3'-methyl- , 3',5'-dimethyl-  and 3',4',5'-trimethyl ether derivatives.
the single amino acid residue in taomt <dig>  val <dig>  determines its preference for tricetin as the substrate, and may define the evolutionary differences between the two closely related proteins, comt and flavone omt.
the partly buried tricetin active site, as well as proximity and orientation effects ensured sequential methylation of the substrate within the same pocket.
we propose a mechanism for the sequential methylation of tricetin, and discuss the potential application of taomt <dig> to increase the production of tricin as a nutraceutical.
this model revealed unique structural features of taomt <dig> which permit the stepwise methylation of tricetin.
mutational analysis of structurally guided active site residues identified those involved in binding and catalysis.
