this suggests that in cattle γδ t cells play a more important role in immune function since they would be predicted to bind a greater variety of antigens.
cdna evidence was assessed to validate expression of the variable genes and showed that one to five d genes could be incorporated into a single transcript.
the bovine genome contains a large and diverse repertoire of trd genes when compared to the genomes of "γδ t cell low" species.
γδ t cells differ from αβ t cells with regard to the types of antigen with which their t cell receptors interact; γδ t cell antigens are not necessarily peptides nor are they presented on mhc.
cattle are considered a "γδ t cell high" species indicating they have an increased proportion of γδ t cells in circulation relative to that in "γδ t cell low" species such as humans and mice.
prior to the onset of the studies described here, there was limited information regarding the genes that code for the t cell receptor delta chains of this γδ t cell high species.
we confirmed the presence of five diversity  genes, three junctional  genes and a single constant  gene and describe the organization of the trd locus.
