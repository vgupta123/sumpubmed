the mantle is a conserved organ involved in shell formation throughout molluscs.
in situ hybridization validated and further localized the expression for a subset of these ests.
this investigation has mapped the spatial distribution for over  <dig> ests present on pmaxarray  <dig>  with reference to specific locations of the mantle.
expression profile clusters have indicated at least five unique functioning zones in the mantle.
this study employs molecular approaches to determine the spatial expression of genes within the mantle tissue to further the elucidation of the shell biomineralization.
pmaxarray  <dig>  consists of  <dig> expressed sequence tags  originating from mantle tissue.
the organic component incorporated within the shell is said to dictate this architecture.
this microarray was used to analyze the spatial expression of ests throughout the mantle organ.
