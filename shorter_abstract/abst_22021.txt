compared to the controls, tfr and tr demonstrated significant antimicrobial effects in the redox assays, by viable counts  and in oral rinse samples .
sodium fluoride did not influence the antibacterial and anti-biofilm potency of cpc-containing formulations, supporting the combined use of cpc and sodium fluoride in mouthrinses to control oral bacteria and protect tooth enamel.
cetylpyridinium chloride  and sodium fluoride augment oral hygiene by inactivating bacteria and inhibiting enamel demineralisation, respectively.
effects against planktonic bacteria were determined using viable counting , a redox dye  and viable counting .
inhibition of biofilm formation was evaluated by pre-treating hydroxyapatite coupons with mouthrinses prior to inoculation.
pre-treatment of hydroxyapatite with tfr and tr significantly inhibited biofilm formation .
tfr and tr also significantly reduced the viability of oral biofilms.
effects against saliva-derived biofilms were quantified using confocal microscopy and differential viable counting.
we have used six experimental systems to compare the antibacterial effects of mouthrinses containing  <dig>  % cpc  or  <dig>  % cpc with sodium fluoride .
however, there are few reports in the literature documenting the antibacterial efficacy of their combined use in mouthrinses.
