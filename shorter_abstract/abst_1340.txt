the genetic basis of this life history trait is well studied in many easily propagated phages, making it possible to test the model across a variety of environments and taxa.
their utility for quantitatively predicting phenotypic evolution can be tested experimentally.
the Φx <dig> lysis interval did not evolve detectably when the phage was adapted to normal hosts, indicating complete failure of optimality predictions.
the consistent failure of the optimality model suggests that constraint and genetic details affect quantitative and even qualitative success of optimality predictions.
optimality models of evolution, which ignore genetic details and focus on natural selection, are widely used but sometimes criticized as oversimplifications.
part of st-1's total lysis time evolution consisted of an earlier start to progeny production, an unpredicted phenotypic response outside the boundaries of the optimality model.
Φx <dig> grown on slyd-defective hosts which initially entirely prevented lysis readily recovered to a lysis interval similar to that attained on normal hosts.
finally, the lysis interval still evolved to the same endpoint when the environment was altered to delay optimal lysis interval.
several features of st- <dig> adaptation show that lysis time is best understood as an output of multiple traits, rather than in isolation.
however, there were no changes in the single known lysis gene.
the model predicted the evolution of the lysis interval in response to host density and other environmental factors.
one such model predicts optimal bacteriophage lysis interval, how long a virus should produce progeny before lysing its host bacterium to release them.
st- <dig> lysis interval evolved to be ~ <dig> min shorter, qualitatively in accord with predictions.
