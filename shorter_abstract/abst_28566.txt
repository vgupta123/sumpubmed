therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if the yc combined with t manipulation could influence renal na and k excretion.
rt-pcr was used to demonstrate the presence of renal androgen receptor  transcripts.
in another experiment the androgen receptor was blocked using flutamide in the diet.
t influences electrolyte excretion through an androgen receptor dependent mechanism.
to investigate the role of the yc and t, consomic borderline hypertensive  and normotensive wistar-kyoto  rat strains were used  in three t treatment groups: castrate, castrate with t implant and gonadally intact males.
there was not a differential yc involvement in electrolyte excretion between wky and shr/y males.
plasma aldosterone was decreased in the presence of t. blockade of the ar resulted in a significant increase in na excretion but not in k excretion in both shr/y and wky males.
urine was collected  for na and k measurements by flame photometry.
ar transcripts were identified in shr/y and wky kidneys.
na and k excretion were decreased by t in shr/y and wky.
the y-chromosome  and testosterone  increase blood pressure and may also influence renal electrolyte excretion.
