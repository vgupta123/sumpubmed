this recon furthermore facilitated the development of three alternative methods to study protein secretion through graphical visualizations of omics data.
the recon of the secretory pathway represents a strong tool for interpretation of data related to protein secretion as illustrated with transcriptomic data of chinese hamster ovary  cells, the main platform for mammalian protein production.
protein secretion is one of the most important processes in eukaryotes.
on the basis of manual curation of the literature on the yeast, human, and mouse secretory pathway, we have compiled a comprehensive catalogue of characterized proteins with functional annotation and their interconnectivity.
by employing our mouse recon to the cho-k <dig> genome in a comparative genomic approach, we could reconstruct the protein secretory pathway of cho cells counting  <dig> cho components.
the elucidation of the cell biology of the secretory machinery is of great importance, as it drives protein expression for biopharmaceutical industry, a  <dig> billion usd global market.
it is based on a highly complex machinery involving numerous proteins in several cellular compartments.
we have demonstrated the use of these methods to identify potential new and known targets for engineering improved growth and igg production, as well as the general observation that cho cells seem to have less strict transcriptional regulation of protein secretion than healthy mouse cells.
however, the complexity of secretory process is difficult to describe using a simple reductionist approach, and therefore a promising avenue is to employ the tools of systems biology.
