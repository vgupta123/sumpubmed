in this cross-sectional study, we examined the risk factors associated with within-herd transmission of blv on infected dairy farms in japan.
blood samples taken from  <dig> randomly selected adult cows at each of  <dig> dairy farms were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
control of ebl in infected dairy farms in japan will be improved by focusing particularly on these risk and protective factors.
effective control of ebl requires that the transmission routes of bovine leukemia virus  infection should be identified and intercepted based on scientific evidence.
a mixed logistic regression analysis implicated a loose housing system, dehorning, and a large number of horseflies in summer as risk factors  and feeding of colostrum to newborn calves from their dams as a protective factor  against within-farm transmission of blv on infected farms.
