horizontal gene transfer  is the stable transmission of genetic material between organisms by means other than vertical inheritance.

hgt has an important role in the evolution of prokaryotes but is relatively rare in eukaryotes.
we identified eleven hgt events from bacteria into members of the genus colletotrichum or their ancestors.
the hgt events include genes involved in amino acid, lipid and sugar metabolism as well as lytic enzymes.
we found no evidence of a burst of hgt events coinciding with major geological events.
genes that are typically transferred by hgt are those that are constantly subject to gene duplication and gene loss.
in contrast, hgt appears to be a constant, albeit rare phenomenon in the pezizomycotina, occurring at a steady rate during their evolution.
we studied the importance of hgt in plant pathogenic fungi by identifying horizontally transferred genes in the genomes of three members of the genus colletotrichum.
additionally, the putative minimal dates of transference were calculated using a time calibrated phylogenetic tree.
the functions of some of these genes suggest roles in niche adaptation and virulence.
