the results reveal that cyndi is capable of generating geometrically diverse conformers and outperforms other four multiple conformer generators in the case of reproducing the bioactive conformations against  <dig> structures.
in this work, we described an efficient conformation sampling method named cyndi, which is based on multi-objective evolution algorithm.
many applications require sampling the broad molecular conformational space or perceiving the bioactive conformers to ensure success.
conformation generation is a ubiquitous problem in molecule modelling.
testing the performance of cyndi against a test set consisting of  <dig> small molecules reveals an average minimum rmsd of  <dig>  Ã… to corresponding bioactive conformations, indicating cyndi is highly competitive against other conformation generation methods.
on the basis of moea algorithm, we present a new, highly efficient conformation generation method, cyndi, and report the results of validation and performance studies comparing with other four methods.
various objectives are designated to render the generated pareto optimal conformers to be energy-favoured as well as evenly scattered across the conformational space.
the conformational perturbation is subjected to evolutionary operation on the genome encoded with dihedral torsions.
an optional objective concerning the degree of molecular extension is added to achieve geometrically extended or compact conformations which have been observed to impact the molecular bioactivity .
