these subtypes were associated with significant differences in relapse-free and overall survival.
multivariate cox analysis of the combined test set showed that the intrinsic subtype classifications added significant prognostic information that was independent of standard clinical predictors.
when the new intrinsic gene set was used to hierarchically cluster this combined test set, tumors were grouped into luma, lumb, basal-like, her2+/er-, and normal breast-like tumor subtypes that we demonstrated in previous datasets.
a 105-tumor training set containing  <dig> sample pairs was used to derive a new breast tumor intrinsic gene list.
from the combined test set, we developed an objective and unchanging classifier based upon five intrinsic subtype mean expression profiles , which is designed for single sample predictions .
to overcome this problem we used publicly available breast cancer gene expression data sets and a novel approach to data fusion, in order to validate a new breast tumor intrinsic list.
this intrinsic list contained  <dig> genes and a proliferation signature that was not present in previous breast intrinsic gene sets.
validation of a novel gene expression signature in independent data sets is a critical step in the development of a clinically useful test for cancer patient risk-stratification.
