we treat each test statistic as a basic attribute, and model the detection of differentially expressed genomic features as learning a discriminant boundary in a multi-dimensional space of basic attributes.

we propose to capture differential expression information more comprehensively by integrating multiple test statistics, each of which has relatively limited capacity to summarize the observed differential expression information.
making insufficient distributional assumptions can lead to inferior results when dealing with complex differential expression patterns.
we have developed a novel machine learning methodology for robust differential expression analysis, which can be a new avenue to significantly advance research on large-scale differential expression analysis.
an effective algorithm, discriminant-cut, has been developed to solve an instantiation of this problem.
extensive comparisons of discriminant-cut with  <dig> existing methods were carried out to demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness.
we mathematically formulated our goal as a constrained optimization problem aiming to maximize discoveries satisfying a user-defined fdr.
this work addresses a general application scenario, in which users want to detect as many as defs while requiring the false discovery rate  to be lower than a cut-off.
performing statistical tests is an important step in analyzing genome-wide datasets for detecting genomic features differentially expressed between conditions.
