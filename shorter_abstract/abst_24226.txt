chip-pcr assay using anti-dimethyl-histone h3-k <dig> and anti-acetyl-histone h3-k <dig> antibodies revealed increased h3-k <dig> dimethylation and reduced h3-k <dig> acetylation around the atxn8os cdna gene in  <dig> cr line.
addition of doxycycline leads to 25~ <dig> times more atxn8os rna expression with a repeat length-dependent increase in fold of atxn8os rna induction.
the repeat length-dependent increase in induction fold is probably due to the increased rna stability as demonstrated by monitoring atxn8os rna decay in cells treated with the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin d. in cells stably expressing atxn8os, rna fish experiments further revealed ribonuclear foci formation in cells carrying expanded  <dig> and  <dig> cr.
in the absence of doxycycline, the stable atxn8os cr cell lines exhibit low levels of atxn8os expression and a repeat length-related increase in staurosporine sensitivity and in the number of annexin positive cells.
a repeat length-dependent repression of atxn8os expression was also notable.
spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>  involves the expression of an expanded ctg/cag combined repeats  from opposite strands producing cug expansion transcripts  and a polyglutamine expansion protein .
