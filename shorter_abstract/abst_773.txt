these findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns and the function in starvation of storage proteins.
although insects possess storage hexamerins, very little is known about the character and specific functions of hexamerin  <dig> and storage protein  <dig> in insect development.
rna interference results revealed that storage protein genes are key in metamorphosis, reproduction and insect development.
northern blotting analyses revealed that sehex mrna is expressed in the fat body, cuticle, midgut and malpighian tubules and sesp <dig> in fat body, malpighian tubules and tracheae.
sehex and sesp <dig> mrnas were expressed in fat body at different levels from first instar larvae to pupae, with expression was much lower from first instar larvae to first-day fifth instar larvae.
sesp <dig> transcript expression was high in fat body of wandering larvae, 2-day-old fifth instar larvae and 2-, 4- and 7-day-old pupae.
storage hexamerins are important members of the hemocyanin superfamily.
the results for sehex and sesp <dig> interference reveal that a potential method to control this pest is to disrupt the regulation of storage proteins.
in insects, hemocyanin superfamily proteins accumulate apparently to serve as sources of amino acids during metamorphosis, reproduction and development.
s. exigua hexamerin  <dig>  cdna contained an open reading frame of  <dig> nucleotides encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda.
s. exigua storage protein  <dig>  cdna contained an open reading frame of  <dig> bp encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of ~ <dig>  kda.
to gain insight into the function of storage proteins in insects, cdnas for two storage proteins were cloned from the fat body of spodoptera exigua.
sehex transcript expression was high in fat body of wandering larvae  and steadily decreased to the seventh pupal day.
