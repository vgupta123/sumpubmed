we have shown that the same genes that heal puncture wounds are also activated after oral-aboral bisection, indicating a clear link with the initiation of regenerative healing.
wound healing is the first stage of a series of cellular events that are necessary to initiate a regenerative response.
to gain a greater understanding of how early animals generate a regenerative response, we examined the cellular and molecular components involved during wound healing in the anthozoan cnidarian nematostella vectensis.
this study also identified a novel cnidarian-specific gene, for a thiamine biosynthesis enzyme , that may have been incorporated into the genome by lateral gene transfer from bacteria and now functions during wound healing.

we identified a number of genes directly related to the wound healing response in other animals  and suggest that glycoproteins  play a key role in early wound healing events.
this research describes the temporal events involved during nematostella wound healing, and provides a foundation for comparative analysis with other regenerative and non-regenerative species.
defective wound healing can block regeneration even in animals with a high regenerative capacity.
lastly, we suggest that erk signaling is a shared element of the early wound response for animals with a high regenerative capacity.
we characterized early and late wound healing events through genome-wide microarray analysis, quantitative pcr, and in situ hybridization to identify potential wound healing targets.
cnidarians are the phylogenetic sister taxa to bilaterians and are highly regenerative animals.
