however, the reconstruction of full-length mrnas via de novo rna-seq assembly is still difficult due to the complexity of eukaryote transcriptomes with highly similar paralogs and multiple alternative splice variants.
based on a de novo transcriptome assembly , frama annotated  <dig>  naked mole-rat mrnas , corresponding to  <dig>  genes.
frama realizes the de novo construction of a low-redundant transcript catalog for eukaryotes, including the extension and refinement of transcripts.
further, our results demonstrate the competitiveness of frama to state of the art genome-based transcript reconstruction approaches.
thereby, results delivered by frama provide the basis for comprehensive downstream analyses like gene expression studies or comparative transcriptomics.
a comparison with three different sources of naked mole-rat transcripts reveals that frama’s gene models are better supported by rna-seq data than any other transcript set.
here, we present frama, a genome-independent annotation tool for de novo mrna assemblies that addresses several post-assembly tasks, such as reduction of contig redundancy, ortholog assignment, correction of misassembled transcripts, scaffolding of fragmented transcripts and coding sequence identification.
