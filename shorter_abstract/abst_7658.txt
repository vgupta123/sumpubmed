in the mouse, 1) pancrna-partnered genes confined their expression pattern to certain tissues compared to pancrna-lacking genes, 2) expression of pancrnas was significantly correlated with the enrichment of active chromatin marks, h3k <dig> trimethylation and h3k <dig> acetylation, at the promoter regions of the partner genes, 3) h3k4me <dig> marked the pancrna-partnered genes regardless of their expression level, and 4) c- or g-skewed motifs were exclusively overrepresented between− <dig> and−1 bp relative to the transcription start sites of the pancrna-partnered genes.
the present study raises the interesting possibility that the gain and/or loss of gene-activation-associated pancrna repertoires, caused by formation or disruption of the genomic gc-skewed structure in the course of evolution, finely shape the tissue-specific pattern of gene expression according to a given species.
here, we identify thousands of genes under pancrna-mediated transcriptional activation in five mammalian species in common.
more importantly, the comparative transcriptome analysis among five different mammalian species using a total of  <dig> counterpart tissues showed that the overall pancrna expression profile exhibited extremely high species-specificity compared to that of total mrna, suggesting that interspecies difference in pancrna repertoires might lead to the diversification of mrna expression profiles.
in particular, we have reported that promoter-associated ncrnas  activate the partner gene expression via local epigenetic changes.
recent transcriptome analyses have shown that long non-coding rnas  play extensive roles in transcriptional regulation.
