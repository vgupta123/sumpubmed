arabidopsis zbf1/myc2bhlh transcription factor is a repressor of photomorphogenesis, and acts as a point of cross talk in light, abscisic acid  and jasmonic acid  signaling pathways.
overexpression of lemyc <dig> has led to increased root length with more number of lateral roots.
collectively, this study highlights that working in light, aba and ja signaling pathways lemyc <dig> works as an important regulator for growth and development in tomato plants.
the amino acid sequence of lemyc <dig> showed extensive homology with arabidopsis myc <dig>  containing the conserved bhlh domain.
the tomato plants overexpressing lemyc <dig> have reduced internode distance with more branches, and display the opposite morphology to rnai transgenic lines.
examination of seedling morphology, physiological responses and light regulated gene expression has revealed that lemyc <dig> works as a negative regulator of blue light mediated photomorphogenesis.
furthermore, this study shows that lemyc <dig> promotes aba and ja responsiveness.
furthermore, lemyc <dig> specifically binds to the g-box of lerbcs-3a promoter.
however, the function of myc <dig> in growth and development remains unknown in crop plants.
myc <dig> also functions as a positive regulator of lateral root development and flowering time under long day conditions.
