heritable forms of epidermolysis bullosa  constitute a heterogeneous group of skin disorders of genetic aetiology that are characterised by skin and mucous membrane blistering and ulceration in response to even minor trauma.
two of the animals were necropsied and showed oral mucosal blistering, skin ulcerations and partly loss of horn on the claws.
our investigation confirms the known role of laminin gamma  <dig> in eb aetiology and shows the importance of whole genome sequencing in the analysis of rare diseases in livestock.
verifying the homozygous private variants present in candidate genes allowed us to quickly identify the causative mutation and contribute to the final diagnosis of junctional eb in hereford cattle.
here we report the occurrence of eb in three danish hereford cattle from one herd.
we performed whole genome sequencing of one affected calf and searched all coding dna variants.
lesions were histologically characterized by subepidermal blisters and ulcers.
this loss of function mutation completely removes the start codon of this gene and is therefore predicted to be completely disruptive.
analysis of the family tree indicated that inbreeding and the transmission of a single recessive mutation from a common ancestor could be causative.
