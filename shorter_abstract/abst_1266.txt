in particular, the lack of genomic information from a variety of r. anatipestifer strains has proved severely limiting.
in this study, we present the complete genomes of two r. anatipestifer strains, ra-ch- <dig>  and ra-ch- <dig> .
this information will allow a better understanding of the phenotype of different r. anatipestifer strains and molecular mechanisms of infection.
the genomes of ra-ch- <dig> and ra-gd were extremely similar, while ra-ch- <dig> was significantly different than atcc <dig>  ra-ch- <dig> is  <dig>  bp larger than the three other strains and has  <dig> unique gene families.
riemerella anatipestifer is one of the most important pathogens of ducks.
