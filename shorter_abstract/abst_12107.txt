on empirical bacterial protein-protein interaction networks  and gene co-expression networks, graphalignment outperforms græmlin  <dig>  with respect to coverage and specificity, albeit by a small margin.
the simplicity and generality of graphalignment edge scoring makes the algorithm an appropriate choice for global alignment of networks.
on simulated data, graphalignment outperforms græmlin  <dig>  in several benchmarks except for computational complexity.
the graphalignment algorithm is robust to spurious vertex associations, correctly resolves paralogs, and shows very good performance in identification of homologous vertices defined by high vertex and/or interaction similarity.
we introduce the bioconductor package graphalignment for pairwise alignment of bio-molecular networks.
