germline genetic variation is associated with the differential expression of many human genes.
this study identifies cis-regulators of germline c-myc expression in immortalized lymphocytes of hapmap individuals.
three regions at 8q <dig> have recently been identified to independently confer risk of prostate cancer.
quantitative analysis of c-myc expression in normal prostate tissues suggests an association between overexpression and variants in region  <dig> of prostate cancer risk.
somatic c-myc overexpression correlates with prostate cancer progression and more aggressive tumor forms, which was also a pathological variable associated with region  <dig>  expression profiling analysis and modeling of transcriptional regulatory networks predicts a functional association between myc and the prostate tumor suppressor klf <dig>  analysis of myc/myc-driven cell transformation and tumorigenesis substantiates a model in which myc overexpression promotes transformation by down-regulating klf <dig>  in this model, a feedback loop through e-cadherin down-regulation causes further transactivation of c-myc.
this study proposes that variation at putative 8q <dig> cis-regulator of transcription can significantly alter germline c-myc expression levels and, thus, contribute to prostate cancer susceptibility by down-regulating the prostate tumor suppressor klf <dig> gene.
variation at 8q <dig> has also recently been associated with risk of breast and colorectal cancer.
