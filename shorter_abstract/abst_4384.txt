the method is demonstrated here for genotyping single-nucleotide alleles of the human hexa gene responsible for tay-sachs disease and for genotyping snp alleles near the human p <dig> tumor suppressor gene.
these assays are robust because they are consistent over a wide range of input dna concentrations and give the same results regardless of how many cycles of linear amplification have elapsed.
two-temperature late-pcr endpoint genotyping combines linear-after-the-exponential -pcr  and mismatch-tolerant probes capable of detecting allele-specific targets at high temperature and total single-stranded amplicons at a lower temperature in the same reaction.
snp genotyping via two-temperature late-pcr takes place in a homogeneous closed-tube format and uses a single hybridization probe per snp site.
these assays are convenient, rely on endpoint analysis, improve the options for construction of multiplex assays, and are suitable for snp genotyping, mutation scanning, and detection of dna duplication or deletions.
in conventional pcr, total amplicon yield becomes independent of starting template number as amplification reaches plateau and varies significantly among replicate reactions.
furthermore, the use of only a single colored probe for genotyping enhances the multiplex detection capacity of the assay.
the resulting method corrects for product yield variations among replicate amplification reactions, permits resolution of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes based on endpoint fluorescence signal intensities, and readily identifies imbalanced allele ratios equivalent to those arising from gene/chromosomal duplications.
this paper describes a strategy for reconfiguring pcr so that the signal intensity of a single fluorescent detection probe after pcr thermal cycling reflects genomic composition.
