here we describe the whole-genome resequencing of eight accessions  chosen to represent a large range of intra-specific variability and the identification and annotation of novel polymorphisms.
substantial genetic differences exist between the sequenced tomato accessions and the reference sequence.
the distribution of snps and indels across and within chromosomes was highly heterogeneous revealing introgressions from wild species and the mosaic structure of the genomes of the cherry tomato accessions.
the completion of the tomato genome sequence and recent advances in dna sequencing technology allow for in-depth characterization of genetic variation present in the tomato genome.
comparison of the sequences with the reference genome yielded more than  <dig> million single nucleotide polymorphisms .
like many self-pollinated crops, cultivated tomato accessions show a low molecular but high phenotypic diversity.
this study represents the first whole genome resequencing experiment in cultivated tomato.
