we profiled the metabolic composition of kernels from field-grown plants of the rice diversity research set using  <dig> complementary analytical platforms.
multivariate regression analysis showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> studied quality traits could be predicted from the metabolic composition independently of the population structure.
here we show that the untargeted high-coverage metabolomic characterization of such core collections is a powerful approach for studying the molecular backgrounds of quality traits and for constructing predictive metabolome-trait models.
we found that the metabolite profiles were correlated with both the overall population structure and fine-grained genetic diversity.
our results demonstrate the utility of metabolomics for linking traits with quantitative molecular data.
furthermore, the model of amylose ratio could be validated using external varieties grown in an independent experiment.
