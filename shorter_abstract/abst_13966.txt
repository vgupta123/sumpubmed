cotyledon mutants are important for the genetic dissection of embryo patterning and seed development.
consistent with assays of hormones in seeds, the results of rna-seq indicated auxin and aba biosynthesis and signal transduction in cco were more active than in wt, while an early step in ga biosynthesis was blocked, as well as conversion rate of inactive gas to bioactive gas in ga signaling.
the entire embryos of cco mutant resembled the “tail of swallow”.
rna-seq identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  between wt and the cco mutant.
furthermore, genes participated in other hormone biosynthesis and signalling pathways such as cytokinin , ethylene , brassinosteroid , and jasmonate acid  were also affected in the cco mutant.
our data suggest that multiple phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways are reprogrammed in cco, and changes in these pathways may partially contribute to the cco mutant phenotype, suggesting the involvement of multiple hormones in the coordination of soybean cotyledon development.
compared with wild-type , anatomical analysis revealed that the cco cotyledons at the torpedo stage became more slender and grew outward.
the kegg pathway analysis showed many degs were mapped to the hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways.
in addition, cco seeds displayed reduced germination rate and gibberellic acid  level, whereas the abscisic acid  and auxin  levels were increased.
however, the molecular mechanisms underlying soybean cotyledon development are largely unexplored.
