moreover, both a binomial p-value/q-value and an empirical fdr were found to predict the true fdr within 2â€“ <dig> fold and are more reliable estimators of confidence than a global poisson p-value.
here we present a package of algorithms and software that makes use of control input data to reduce false positives and estimate confidence in chip-seq peaks.
the methods developed and tested here show considerable promise for reducing false positives and estimating confidence in chip-seq data without any prior knowledge of the chip target.
several different methods were compared using two simulated spike-in datasets.
's neuron-restrictive silencer factor  chip-seq data without relying on extensive qpcr validated nrsf sites and the presence of nrsf binding motifs for setting thresholds.
use of control input data and a normalized difference score were found to more than double the recovery of chip-seq peaks at a 5% false discovery rate .
in these experiments, chromatin immunoprecipitation is used to enrich for particular dna sequences of interest and signature sequencing is used to map the regions to the genome .
