in enteroviruses, a clear understanding of the characteristics of tree topology, transmission, and its demographic dynamics in viral succession and circulation are essential for identifying prevalence trends in endemic pathogens such as coxsackievirus b <dig> .
the balance indices, high similarity, and low evolutionary rate in the vp <dig> region indicated mild herd immunity selection in the major capsid region.
phylodynamic analysis can reveal demographic trends and herd immunity in endemic pathogens.
studies regarding coxsackievirus  tend to focus on epidemic outbreaks, an imbalanced topology is considered to be an indication of acute infection with partial cross-immunity.
some strains with tree discordance indicated the occurrence of recombination in the region between the vp <dig> and 3dpol genes.
the similarities of vp <dig> and 3dpol gene were  <dig>  %– <dig>  % and  <dig>  %– <dig>  %, respectively.
