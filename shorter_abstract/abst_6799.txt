the objective of this study was to evaluate the extent of ld in nellore cattle using a high density snp panel and  <dig> genotyped steers.
knowledge of the linkage disequilibrium  between markers is important to establish the number of markers necessary for association studies and genomic selection.
the level of ld estimated for markers separated by less than  <dig> kb indicates that the high density bovine snp beadchip will likely be a suitable tool for prediction of genomic breeding values in nellore cattle.
the minor allele frequency  was less than  <dig>  in a considerable proportion of snps.
the ld  between markers was higher when the maf threshold was high , especially when the distance between markers was short.
the overall mean ld between marker pairs measured by r <dig> and |d'| was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
the mean distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  kb.
the ld  decreased with increasing physical distance between markers from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .
