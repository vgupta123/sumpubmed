the active form of vitamin d,  <dig> -dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> , has strong anti-proliferative effects, yet the molecular mechanisms underneath this effect remain unclear.
in contrast, the molecular mechanism of  <dig> d for the regulation of calcium homeostasis has principally been resolved, demonstrating a pivotal role for the vitamin d receptor .
this unanticipated finding led us to take an alternative approach using genome wide screens to study the molecular mechanisms of  <dig> d in proliferation.
expression arrays revealed that no single gene was differentially expressed between the sensitive and resistant cells, but multiple membrane receptor signaling pathways were altered in the  <dig> d resistant cell lines.
importantly, in the genome wide experiments neither vdr, cyp24a <dig> nor other known vitamin d signaling pathway genes were associated with  <dig> d resistance.
in conclusion, sirna and genome wide studies both suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d in mcf <dig> breast tumor cell lines do not rely on classical vitamin d pathway per se.
array cgh identified a copy number alteration in a region of  <dig>  mb at chromosome 11q <dig> - <dig>  common to all four  <dig> d resistant cell lines.
