notably, this analysis revealed a cluster of upregulated neuronal genes densely covered by h3k27me <dig>  consistent with programming toward the neural lineage by syt-ssx <dig> observed previously.
to gain a clear understanding of syt-ssx <dig> control of gene expression networks, we conducted a thorough genome-wide analysis to determine the mechanism of its recruitment and identify signature sets of epigenetic markers that would predict its targeting and transcriptional activity.
further research into this mechanism is crucial to the full understanding of ss biology.
the data analysis revealed that polycomb complexes or their modified chromatin and their stably silenced differentiation programs seem to be the main target for syt-ssx <dig>  suggesting that their perturbation is at the center of tumorigenesis driven by the oncogene.
this reprogramming was due to the direct occupancy of proneural genes by the syt-ssx <dig> nuclear complex.
syt-ssx is the oncogene associated with synovial sarcoma , a stem cell disease.
it interacts with components of polycomb and swi/snf complexes, the two epigenetic controllers that maintain the heritable status of differentiation-specific genes in the stem/progenitor cell.
through these associations syt-ssx is thought to alter gene expression programs by epigenetic mechanisms.
hierarchical and functional clustering identified h3k27me <dig> as the dominant epigenetic marker associated with syt-ssx <dig> binding and gene expression.
syt-ssx <dig> was recruited to distinct loci across all chromosomes, and an overwhelming number of polycomb-modified sites enriched with the trimethylated histone h <dig> on lysine  <dig>  formed the main recruiting module for syt-ssx <dig>  not all syt-ssx2/h3k27me3-occupied genes had altered expression, denoting the requirement for additional signals upon oncogene binding.
recently, we reported that syt-ssx <dig> reprograms mesenchymal stem cells and myoblasts by dictating their commitment to the neural lineage while disrupting their normal differentiation.
most activated genes had syt-ssx <dig> sites enriched with h3k27me <dig> within their body or near their transcription start site  whereas a majority of downregulated genes were characterized by syt-ssx2/h3k27me3-rich regions at long-range, or by modifications associated with transcription activation within the gene body or near the tss.
