in parallel to what has been observed for other animal species, we hypothesized that such an intervention may have negative impact on immune development.
validation of the predicted functional changes was performed by staining immune cells in the small intestinal mucosa and a reduction in the number of macrophage-like  cells was observed due to a direct or indirect effect of the antibiotic treatment.
we provide evidence that a short, early life antibiotic treatment affects both the intestinal microbiota  and mucosal gene expression over a period of 2 weeks.
these results underscore the importance of early life microbial colonization of the gut in relation to immune development and the necessity to explore the capabilities of a variety of early life dietary and/or environmental factors to modulate the programming for immune competence in broilers.

we investigated the effect of a perturbation of the normal early life microbial colonization of the jejunum in 1-day old chickens.
gut microbial colonization and development of immune competence are intertwined and are influenced by early-life nutritional, environmental, and management factors.
