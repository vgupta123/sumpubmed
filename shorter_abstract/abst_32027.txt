weighted correlation network analysis  can be used for finding clusters  of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits , and for calculating module membership measures.
the wgcna r software package is a comprehensive collection of r functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis.
the wgcna package provides r functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g.
the package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software.
for example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples.
co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.
correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications.
correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets.
while parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
along with the r package we also present r software tutorials.
the r package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at .
