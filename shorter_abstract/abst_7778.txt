this is the first transgenic protocol to be developed in an insect species that exhibits an exaggerated male sexual trait.
we have performed stable germline transformation of a stalk-eyed fly, t. dalmanni.
germline transformation with an overall efficiency of 4% was achieved using a minos based vector and the 3xp3-egfp marker construct.
functional analyses of these genes to confirm and fully characterise their roles in eye-stalk growth require the development of techniques such as germline transformation to manipulate gene activity in vivo.
relatively little is known about the molecular genetic basis of intra- or inter-species variation in eyespan, eye-stalk development or growth regulation in diopsids.
chromosomal insertion of constructs was confirmed by southern blot analysis.
mariner based vectors showed no detectable excision while both minos and piggybac were active in stalk-eyed fly embryos.
eyespan, the distance between the eyes, and the degree of sexual dimorphism in eyespan vary considerably between species and several sexually dimorphic species show sexual selection through female mate preference for males with exaggerated eyespan.
transgenesis will enable the development of a range of techniques for analysing gene function in this species and so provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the development of a morphological trait subject to sexual selection.
this will greatly facilitate the identification of genes which are differentially expressed during eye-stalk development in males and females.
we used in vivo excision assays to identify transposon vector systems with the activity required to mediate transgenesis in t. dalmanni.
our x-linked insertion line will permit the sex of live larvae to be determined.
