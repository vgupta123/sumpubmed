a crm is characterized by a set of co-occurring transcription factor binding sites .
as a result their usage is limited to finding crms in small datasets  and using binding sites for a restricted number of transcription factors  out of which the optimal module will be selected.
we show that by exploiting the computational efficiency of an itemset mining approach and combining it with a well-designed statistical scoring scheme, we were able to prioritize the biologically valid crms in a large set of coregulated genes using binding sites for a large number of potential tfs as input.
