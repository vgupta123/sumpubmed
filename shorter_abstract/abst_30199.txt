the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig> , in particular is rich in useful genes, and as it may increase yield, protein content and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, it has been introgressed into wheat as the 1bl.1rs translocation.
this work demonstrates the utility of chromosome arm-specific bac libraries for targeted analysis of large triticeae genomes and provides new sequence data from the rye genome and molecular markers for the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig>
the gc content of the sequenced fraction of 1rs is  <dig> %, and at least 84% of the 1rs arm consists of repetitive dna.
a better knowledge of the rye genome could facilitate rye improvement and increase the efficiency of utilizing rye genes in wheat breeding.
here, we report on bac end sequencing of  <dig>  clones from two 1rs-specific bac libraries.
it is one of the parents of man-made species triticale and has been used as a source of agronomically important genes for wheat improvement.
rye  belongs to tribe triticeae and is an important temperate cereal.
we obtained  <dig>   useful sequences with a cumulative length of  <dig> , <dig> bp and an average read length of  <dig> bp.
these sequences represent  <dig> % of 1rs arm.
we identified transposable element junctions in bess and developed insertion site based polymorphism markers .
