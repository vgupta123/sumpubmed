in response to serum or growth factors these two classes of co-activators are activated by different upstream signal transduction pathways.
the promoters of the serum-inducible genes were analyzed for srf binding sites and other common regulatory elements.
the analysis for other common regulatory elements is discussed.
in order to identify the serum-inducible srf target genes that are specifically dependent on the mkl pathway, we have performed microarray experiments using a cell line that expresses dominant negative mkl <dig>  this approach was used to identify srf target genes whose activation is mkl-dependent.
these results suggest that a subset of immediate early and srf target genes are activated by the rho-mkl pathway.
twenty-eight of  <dig> serum-inducible genes were found to be mkl-dependent.
however, it is not clear how they differentially activate srf target genes.
mkl may also contribute to the induction of other srf target genes however its role is not essential, possibly due to other activation mechanisms such as mapk phosphorylation of tcfs.
in the case of the ubiquitously expressed immediate early genes, the two sets of srf binding proteins that regulate its activity are the tcf family of proteins that include elk <dig>  sap <dig> and sap <dig> and the myocardin-related mkl family of proteins that include mkl <dig> and mkl <dig> .
additional partial matches to the consensus srf binding site were found at a higher than expected rate in the mkl-dependent gene promoters.
