for genetic content and arrangement of genes associated with erythritol,
functional erythritol transporters, phylogenetic analysis suggests they may
three distinct erythritol/polyol loci arrangements have been identified that
core erythritol catabolic genes and contrasted with the species phylogeny.
trees of core erythritol catabolic genes with species phylogeny provides
erythritol, adonitol and l-arabitol in sinorhizobium meliloti, we
that loci for erythritol and polyol utilization had distinct arrangements
additionally, phylogenetic trees were constructed for genes that showed
differences in arrangement among the putative erythritol loci in these
became interested in the differences between the erythritol loci of s.
