below the filter, the cytoplasmic vestibule is occluded by a plug-like motif attached to an array of pore-lining charged residues.
the asymmetric filter-like structure at the pore center of sstric might serve as the basis for the channel to bind and select monovalent cations.
at the central region, a filter-like structure is shaped by the kinks on the second and fifth transmembrane helices and two nearby phenylalanine residues.
like the mammalian tric channels, sstric is permeable to both k+ and na+ with a slight preference for k+, and is nearly impermeable to ca2+, mg2+, or clâ€“.
here we report detailed insights into the ion- and water-binding sites inside the pore of a tric channel from sulfolobus solfataricus .
recent studies on the representative members of eukaryotic and prokaryotic tric channels demonstrated that they form homotrimeric units with the ion-conducting pores contained within each individual monomer.
a velcro-like plug-pore interacting model has been proposed and suggests a unified framework accounting for the gating mechanisms of prokaryotic and eukaryotic tric channels.
trimeric intracellular cation  channels are crucial for ca2+ handling in eukaryotes and are involved in k+ uptake in prokaryotes.
