comparison of the nd- <dig> genome sequence with the assembled columbia- <dig>  genome sequence identified putative single nucleotide polymorphisms  throughout the entire genome.
molecular markers facilitate both genotype identification, essential for modern animal and plant breeding, and the isolation of genes based on their map positions.
this technology will particularly facilitate the development of high density molecular marker maps, essential for cloning genes based on their genetic map positions and identifying tightly linked molecular markers for selecting desirable genotypes in animal and plant breeding experiments.
the sbp marker technology described here allowed the development of molecular markers for targeted genomic regions of arabidopsis.
advancements in sequencing technology have made possible the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms  for any genomic regions.
here a sequence based polymorphic  marker technology for generating molecular markers for targeted genomic regions in arabidopsis is described.
it should facilitate isolation of co-dominant molecular markers for targeted genomic regions of any animal or plant species, whose genomic sequences have been assembled.
by applying this technology,  <dig> sbp markers for the marker poor regions of the arabidopsis map representing polymorphisms between col- <dig> and nd- <dig> ecotypes were generated.
