recent studies have demonstrated that small rnas, play an important role in maintaining the genome reconstruction and stability.
the study showed that sirnas and dna methylation play an important role in maintaining the genome stability in the formation of an allotetraploid.
the mirnas regulate gene expression and induce the phenotype variation, which may play an important role in the occurrence of heterosis in the allotetraploid.
hybridisation makes a different genome combined in the same cell, and genome “shock” and instability occur during this process, whereas chromosome doubling results in doubling and reconstructing the genome dosage.
the small rnas results showed that the expression levels of mirnas increased in the allodiploid and allotetraploid compared with the parents, and the expression levels of sirnas increased and decreased compared with the parents b. rapa and b. nigra, respectively.
the phenotypic analysis exhibited that the allotetraploid had high heterosis compared with their parents and the allodiploid.
furthermore, qrt-pcr analysis showed that the expression levels of the target genes were negatively corrected with the expressed mirnas.
however, to date, little is known regarding the role of small rnas during the process of wide hybridisation and chromosome doubling, which is essential to elucidate the mechanism of polyploidisation.

therefore, the genetic and dna methylation alterations and changes in the sirna and mirna were assessed during the formation of an allodiploid and its allotetraploid between brassica rapa and brassica nigra in the present study.
an allopolyploid formation consists of the two processes of hybridisation and chromosome doubling.
the findings of this study may provide new information for elucidating that the allotetraploids have a growth advantage over the parents and the allodiploids.
