the analysis of the rnaseqatlas presented here reveals strong differences in gene expression patterns between different organs, especially between root and flower, but also reveals similarities among the gene expression patterns in other organs, such as stem, leaves and aerial buds  or seed and fruit .
additionally, to demonstrate the utility of the avocado gene expression atlas, we investigated the expression patterns of genes implicated in fatty acid metabolism and fruit ripening.
a description of transcriptomic changes occurring during fruit ripening was obtained in mexican avocado, contributing to a dynamic view of the expression patterns of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and the fruit ripening process.
avocado  is an economically important tropical fruit considered to be a good source of fatty acids.
important regulators, functional categories, and differentially expressed genes involved in avocado fruit ripening were identified.
the transcriptomes of seeds, roots, stems, leaves, aerial buds and flowers were determined using different sequencing platforms.
