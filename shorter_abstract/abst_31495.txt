moreover, compared to 18:3-glu elicitation, 13-oxo-13:2-glu induced the differential emission of two monoterpene volatiles  in irlox <dig> plants.
the metabolism of one of the major facs in m. sexta os, n-linolenoyl-glutamic acid , was analyzed on n. attenuata wounded leaf surfaces.
between  <dig> to 70% of the 18:3-glu in the os or of synthetic 18:3-glu were metabolized within  <dig> seconds of application to leaf wounds.
the metabolism of one of the major elicitors of herbivore-specific responses in n. attenuata plants, 18:3-glu, results in the formation of oxidized forms of this fac by a lox-dependent mechanism.
similar to 18:3-glu, 13-oxo-13:2-glu activated the enhanced accumulation of jasmonic acid  in n. attenuata leaves whereas 13-hydroxy-18:3-glu did not.
the formation of these metabolites occurred on the wounded leaf surface and it was dependent on lipoxygenase  activity; plants silenced in the expression of nalox <dig> and nalox <dig> genes showed more than 50% reduced rates of 18:3-glu conversion and accumulated smaller amounts of the oxygenated derivatives compared to wild-type plants.
fatty acid-amino acid conjugates  are major constituents of manduca sexta os and strong elicitors of herbivore-induced defense responses in nicotiana attenuata plants.
one of these derivatives, 13-oxo-13:2-glu, is an active elicitor of ja biosynthesis and differential monoterpene emission.
