we describe the system architecture and template design of "scratchpads", a data-publishing framework for groups of people to create their own social networks supporting natural history science.
automated semantic annotation and indexing is applied to all content, allowing users to navigate intuitively and curate diverse biological data, including content drawn from third party resources.
scratchpads cater to the particular needs of individual research communities through a common database and system architecture.
the template of our architecture may serve as a model to other research communities developing data publishing frameworks outside biodiversity research.
natural history science is characterised by a single immense goal  that can only be addressed through a seemingly infinite series of smaller studies.
the discipline's failure to meaningfully connect these small studies with natural history's goal has made it hard to demonstrate the value of natural history to a wider scientific community.
a scratchpad allows users to organise data around user-defined or imported ontologies, including biological classifications.
