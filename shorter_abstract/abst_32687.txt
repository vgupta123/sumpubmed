microrna  directed gene repression is an important mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation.
the proposed solution is based on two mirna expression prediction methods – a scaling function and a linear model.
we report that mmpred is capable of generating results similar to that obtained using paired datasets.
the method passed extensive numerical validation based on the binding energy between the mature mirna and 3’ utr region of the target gene.
however, a review of both geo and arrayexpress repositories revealed few such datasets, which was in stark contrast to the large number of messenger rna  only datasets.
comprehensive analyses of how microrna influence biological processes requires paired mirna-mrna expression datasets.
the mmpred pipeline requires only mrna expression data as input and is independent of third party mirna target prediction methods.
