the use of predicate logic as the knowledge representation for modelling enables an explicit representation of the structure of the metabolic network, and enables logical inference techniques to be used for model identification/improvement.
roc analysis and other statistical studies revealed that use of the simpler logical form and larger coverage results in no significant degradation of performance compared to ind <dig>
a logical model of the known metabolic processes in s. cerevisiae was constructed from iff <dig>  an existing flux balance analysis  model, and augmented with information from the kegg online pathway database.
compared to the fba model, the logical model has information on an additional  <dig> putative genes and  <dig> additional reactions.
