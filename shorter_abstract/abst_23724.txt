we present enigma-viewer, an interactive web-based visualization tool for brain scientists to compare statistics such as effect sizes from meta-analysis results on standardized rois  across multiple studies.
it becomes strategically important that the results can be communicated among brain scientists effectively.
these problems could be addressed using interactive visualization strategies that can link those statistics with brain structures in order to provide a better interface to understand brain research results.
enigma-viewer supports presentations and communications of brain research results through effective visualization designs.
the tool incorporates visualization design principles such as focus+context and visual data fusion to enable users to better understand the statistics on brain structures.
