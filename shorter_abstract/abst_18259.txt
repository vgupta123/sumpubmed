gene presence/absence  polymorphisms are commonly observed in plants and are important in individual adaptation and species differentiation.
by systematically investigating these accessions, we identified  <dig>  p/a genes  absent in one or more genomes, averaging  <dig> absent genes per accession.
<dig> % of p/a genes belonged to multi-copy gene families, or  <dig> % to clustered genes.
however, the highest proportion of p/a genes, outnumbered in singleton genes, was observed in the regions near centromeres.
furthermore, the proportion of p/a genes was different among functional gene categories.
an estimate of p/a genes and their frequency distribution in the worldwide arabidopsis accessions was obtained.
our results suggest that there are diverse mechanisms to generate or maintain p/a genes, by which individuals and functionally different genes can selectively maintain p/a polymorphisms for a specific adaptation.
finally, a p/a gene tree showed a diversified population structure in the worldwide arabidopsis accessions.
in addition, a significant correlation was observed between the p/a gene frequency among the  <dig> accessions and the diversity level at p/a loci.
