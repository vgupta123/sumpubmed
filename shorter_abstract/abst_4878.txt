furthermore, we detected yy <dig>  yy <dig>  and mbtps <dig> mrna in primary mouse neurons, microglia cells, and astrocytes.
higher yy <dig> expression levels were detected in microglia cells and astrocytes than in primary neurons.
yy <dig> expression in the heart and lung is constitutively expressed during embryogenesis and in adult mice.
in comparison to yy <dig> and mbtps <dig>  yy <dig> revealed the highest expression level in all cell types.
again, only yy <dig> showed significantly altered gene expression levels among the cell types.
the transcription factor yin yang  <dig>  shares a structural and functional highly homologue dna-binding domain with the ubiquitously expressed yy <dig> protein, which has been implicated in regulating fundamental biological processes.
for the first time, developmental changes of yy <dig> transcription became obvious in various areas of the brain.
towards the understanding of yy <dig> biology, we analyzed in detail the expression pattern of yy <dig> in various organs during embryonic and postnatal mouse development till adulthood.
