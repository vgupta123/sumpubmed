in this study we investigated the potential role of myeloperoxidase in the endothelial cell injury caused by neutrophil-derived microparticles.
microparticles were produced by activating human neutrophils with a calcium ionophore and characterized by flow cytometry and transmission and scanning electron microscopy.
neutrophil microparticles-induced injuries and morphological alterations in human umbilical vein endothelial cells  were evaluated by microscopy and flow cytometry.
hence, the microparticle-associated myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-chloride system may contribute to widespread endothelial cell damage in conditions of neutrophil activation as observed in vasculitis and sepsis.
this compound is only catalyzed by myeloperoxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and chloride ion.
the addition of sodium azide or taurine inhibited and reduced enzymatic activity, respectively.
the addition of sodium azide or myeloperoxidase-specific inhibitor-i consistently reduced the injury to the endothelial cells.
we have demonstrated the presence of active myeloperoxidase in neutrophil microparticles and that the microparticle-associated myeloperoxidase cause injury to endothelial cells.
neutrophil microparticles were characterized as structures bounded by lipid bilayers and were less than 1 μm in diameter.
exposure of huvec to neutrophil microparticles induced a loss of cell membrane integrity and morphological changes.
taurine addition reduced huvec morphological changes.
