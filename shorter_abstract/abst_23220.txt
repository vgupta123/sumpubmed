furthermore, testing  <dig> strains each of v. parahaemolyticus and v. vulnificus, important food borne pathogens, isolated from a variety of geographical locations with the igs-typing method demonstrated distinct igs-typing patterns indicative of subspecies divergence in both populations making this technique equally useful for intraspecies differentiation, as well.
these data, presented here in several cluster analyses, demonstrated successful differentiation of the  <dig> type strains showing that this pcr-based fingerprinting method easily discriminates bacterial strains at the species level among vibrio.
the system was optimized to resolve heteroduplex formation as well as to take advantage of capillary gel electrophoresis technology such that reproducible analyses could be achieved in a rapid manner.
this procedure is particularly well-suited for preliminary species identification and, lends itself nicely to epidemiological investigations providing information more quickly than other time-honoured methods traditionally used in these types of analyses.
the genus vibrio is a diverse group of gram-negative bacteria comprised of  <dig> species.
this rapid, reliable and efficient igs-typing system, especially in combination with 16s rrna gene sequencing, has the capacity to not only discern and identify vibrios at the species level but, in some cases, at the sub-species level, as well.
