in consistence with the amino acids alignment data, the 3' trd component of the recognition sequence is identical to the sequence recognized by the ecoei enzyme.
the aim of this study was characterisation of a putative r-m system ecoa0orf42p identified in the commensal escherichia coli a <dig> 34/ <dig>  strain, which is efficiently used at czech paediatric clinics for prophylaxis and treatment of nosocomial infections and diarrhoea of preterm and newborn infants.
combination of the classical biochemical and bacterial genetics approaches with comparative genomics might contribute effectively to further classification of many other putative type-i enzymes, especially in clinical samples.
this system, designated as ecoao83i, is a new functional member of the type ib family, whose specificity differs from those of known type ib enzymes, as was demonstrated by an immunological cross-reactivity and a complementation assay.
putative restriction-modification system ecoa0orf42p in the commensal escherichia coli strain a <dig> 34/ <dig>  was found to be a member of the type ib family and was designated as ecoao83i.
using the plasmid transformation method and the rm search computer program, we identified the dna recognition sequence of the ecoao83i as ggaatgc.
interestingly, the recognition sequence we determined here is identical to the previously reported prototype sequence for eco377i and its isoschizomers.
