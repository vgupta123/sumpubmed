3) the electrostatic forces on each atom ;
a linux executable with example input and output files is provided as supplementary material.
4) the ph-dependent properties  the pka of all ionizable groups;
the program first computes generalized born radii, via a surface integral and then it uses generalized born radii  to perform electrostic analyses.
the results obtained are comparable to those obtained using state-of-the-art poisson-boltzmann solvers.
generalized born  models offer a convenient computational approximation for the more fundamental approach based on the poisson-boltzmann equation, and allows estimation of pairwise contributions to electrostatic effects in the molecular context.
we have implemented in a single program most common analyses of the electrostatic properties of proteins.
2) the electrostatic solvation free energy;
6) the electrostatic potential at the surface of the molecule;
7) the electrostatic potential in a volume surrounding the molecule;
