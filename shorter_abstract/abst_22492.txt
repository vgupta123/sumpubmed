the hbd tag will attract the hsp <dig> complex, which can render the fusion protein inactive.
despite the availability of extensive set of genetic, molecular biological, biochemical and cell biological tools for analysis of protein function in fission yeast, studies are often hampered by the lack of an effective method allowing for the rapid regulation of protein level or protein activity.
in order to be able to regulate protein function, we have made use of a previous finding that the hormone binding domain of steroid receptors can be used as a regulatory cassette to subject the activity of heterologous proteins to hormonal regulation.
the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe is widely-used as a model organism for the study of a broad range of eukaryotic cellular processes such as cell cycle, genome stability and cell morphology.
the estradiol-regulatable hormone binding domain provides a means to regulate the function of some, though not all, fission yeast proteins.
therefore it will be a powerful tool and it will open experimental approaches in fission yeast that have previously not been possible.
since fission yeast is a widely-used model organism, this will be valuable in many areas of research.
