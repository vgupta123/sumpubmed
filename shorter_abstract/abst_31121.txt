the effects of ear <dig> and ear <dig> in nmda-evoked currents were measured in cultured rat embryonic hippocampal neurons and in hek- <dig> cells expressing recombinant nmdar comprised of glun1a–glun2a or glun1a–glun2b subunits.
the glun2b subunit of the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  modulates many physiological processes including learning, memory, and pain.
thus there is an interest in identifying nmdar antagonists that interact specifically with the glun2b subunit.
recently based on structural analysis between the glun2b subunit and conantokin-g, a toxin that interacts selectively with the glun2b subunit, we designed various peptides that are predicted to act as nmdar antagonists by interacting with the glun2b subunit.
in hippocampal neurons, ear <dig> and ear <dig> reduced the nmda-evoked calcium currents in a dose-dependent and reversible manner with comparable ic <dig>  values of  <dig> and 176 µm, respectively.

the newly designed ear <dig> and ear <dig> peptides were shown to block in reversible manner nmda-evoked currents, and ear <dig> showed a stronger selectivity for glun2b than for glun2a.
