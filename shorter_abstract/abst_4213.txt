elymus sibiricus is an important forage grass in semi-arid regions, but it is difficult to grow for commercial seed production due to high seed shattering.

early degradation of abscission layers was associated with the increased seed shattering in high seed shattering genotype xh <dig>  two cell wall degrading enzymes, cellulase  and polygalacturonase , had different activity in the abscission zone, indicating their roles in differentiation of abscission layer.
the expression profiles of  <dig> candidate transcripts involved in cell wall-degrading enzymes, lignin biosynthesis and phytohormone activity were validated using quantitative real-time pcr ,  <dig> of which were up-regulated in low seed shattering genotype zhn <dig>  suggesting these genes may be associated with reduction of seed shattering.
cdna libraries from abscission zone tissue of xh <dig> and zhn <dig> at 7 days, 21 days and 28 days after heading were constructed and sequenced.
to better understand the underlying mechanism and explore the putative genes related to seed shattering, we conducted a combination of morphological, histological, physiochemical and transcriptome analysis on two e. sibiricus genotypes  that have contrasting seed shattering.
the expression data generated in this study provides an important resource for future molecular biological research in e. sibiricus.
the results show that seed shattering is generally caused by a degradation of the abscission layer.
