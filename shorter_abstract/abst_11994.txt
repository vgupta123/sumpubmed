we also used small-hairpin rnas against gli proteins to evaluate targets and confirm specific gli regulation their expression.
the increasing number of developmental events and molecular mechanisms associated with the hedgehog  pathway from drosophila to vertebrates, suggest that gene regulation is crucial for diverse cellular responses, including target genes not yet described.
the combined yeast-based screening and meme/mast analysis were able to predict gli transcription factor binding sites, and position mapping of these sequences upstream or in the first intron of promoters served to identify new putative target genes of gli regulation.
a recently described yeast-based screening allowed us to identify new hh/gli target genes, functionally important in different contexts of vertebrate embryonic development.
testing in different hh/gli gain- and loss-of-function scenarios we here identified known  and novel hh-regulated genes in zebrafish embryos.
we provide evidence that in zebrafish embryos, hh signaling regulates sfrp <dig>  neo <dig>  and c-myc expression in-vivo.
this study aims to identify novel putative targets of gli transcription factors through a protein-dna binding assay using yeast, and validating a subset of targets both in-vitro and in-vivo.
