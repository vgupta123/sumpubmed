next  generation sequencing is an increasingly important tool for many areas of molecular biology, however, care must be taken when interpreting its output.
we have developed a method for the correction of sequencing errors in data from the illumina solexa sequencing platforms.
for organisms without a reference genome this difficulty is even more challenging.
it does not require a reference genome and is of relevance for microrna studies, unsequenced genomes, variant detection in ultra-deep sequencing and even for rna-seq studies of organisms with sequenced genomes where rna editing is being considered.
identifying sequencing errors from true biological variants is a challenging task.
even a low error rate can cause a large number of errors due to the high number of nucleotides being sequenced.
