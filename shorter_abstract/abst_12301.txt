papaya  is a commercially important crop that produces climacteric fruits with a soft and sweet pulp that contain a wide range of health promoting phytochemicals.
there were many similarities between papaya and tomato especially with respect to the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in primary metabolism, regulation of transcription, biotic and abiotic stress and cell wall metabolism.
despite its importance, little is known about transcriptional modifications during papaya fruit ripening and their control.
xspecies microarray data indicated that transcription factors  of the mads-box, nac and ap2/erf gene families were involved in the control of papaya ripening and revealed that cell wall-related gene expression in papaya had similarities to the expression profiles seen in arabidopsis during hypocotyl development.
