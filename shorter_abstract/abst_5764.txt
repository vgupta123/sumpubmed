next, we show that tgf-β is able to increase the proportion of cd133+ cells in liver cancer cell lines in a way that is stable and persistent across cell division.
our study reveals a self-perpetuating crosstalk between tgf-β signaling and the dna methylation machinery, which can be relevant in the establishment of cellular phenotypes.
this is the first indication of the ability of tgf-β to induce genome-wide changes in dna methylation, resulting in a stable change in the proportion of liver cancer cell subpopulations.
differential methylation in response to tgf-β is under-represented at promoter cpg islands and enriched at gene bodies, including a locus in the body of the de novo dna methyl-transferase dnmt3b gene.
this process is associated with stable genome-wide changes in dna methylation that persist through cell division.
recent evidence suggests that signals from transforming growth factor beta  may increase the survival of these so called tumor initiating cells leading to poor hcc prognosis.
in the present report we describe the differential dna methylome of cd133-negative and cd133-expressing liver cancer cells.
moreover, phenotypic changes induced by tgf-β, including the induction of cd <dig>  are impaired by sirna silencing of de novo dna methyl-transferases.
distinct subpopulations of neoplastic cells within tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma , display pronounced ability to initiate new tumors and induce metastasis.

however, how tgf-β establishes and modifies the key features of these cell subpopulations is not fully understood.
