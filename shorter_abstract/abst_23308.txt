analysis of more than  <dig> short rna libraries has revealed that trfs are precisely generated fragments present in all domains of life , and are not produced by the mirna biogenesis pathway.
trfs,  <dig> to 32 nt long single-stranded rna derived from mature or precursor trnas, are a recently discovered class of small rna that have been found to be present in diverse organisms at read counts comparable to mirnas.
trfs are an abundant class of small rna present in all domains of life whose biogenesis is distinct from mirnas.

consistent with these results, human ago <dig> clash data contains thousands of trf- <dig> and trf- <dig> reads chimeric with mrnas.
human par-clip data shows a striking preference for trf-5s and trf-3s to associate with ago <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rather than ago <dig>  and analysis of positional t to c mutational frequency indicates these trfs associate with argonautes in a manner similar to mirnas.
in human hek <dig> cells trfs associate with argonautes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and not argonaute  <dig> which is the main effector protein of mirna function, but otherwise have very similar properties to mirnas, indicating trfs may play a major role in rna silencing.
