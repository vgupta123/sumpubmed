g+c content may dominate because it both reduces frequency of poly-a-like stretches and correlates with many other dna structural characteristics.
that a probabilistic model using composition of all 5-mers within a nucleosome-sized tiling window accurately predicts intrinsic nucleosome occupancy across an entire genome in vitro.
we find that a simple linear combination of only  <dig> simple dna sequence attributes  explains nucleosome occupancy in vitro and in vivo in a manner comparable to the kaplan model.
g+c content is dominant, alone explaining ~50% of the variation in nucleosome occupancy in vitro.
our findings provide a dramatically simplified means to predict and understand intrinsic nucleosome occupancy.
since g+c content is enriched or depleted at many types of features in diverse eukaryotic genomes, our results suggest that variation in nucleotide composition may have a widespread and direct influence on chromatin structure.
a wide variety of dna sequence features are believed to influence nucleosome formation, including periodic dinucleotide signals, poly-a stretches and other short motifs, and sequence properties that influence dna structure, including base content.
g+c content and frequency of aaaa are the most important features.
