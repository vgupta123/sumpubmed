the unknown role of maltokinases in mycobacterial metabolism and the lack of biochemical data led us to express the mak gene from m. bovis bcg for biochemical characterization.
although the m. tuberculosis h37rv mak gene  was considered essential for growth, no mycobacterial mak has, to date, been characterized.
the sequence of the mak from m. bovis bcg was identical to that from m. tuberculosis strains .
since mak may be a potential drug target in m. tuberculosis, its high-level production and purification in bioactive form provide important tools for further functional and structural studies.
maltose-1-phosphate was detected in mycobacterium bovis bcg extracts in the 1960's but a maltose-1-phosphate synthetase  was only much later purified from actinoplanes missouriensis, allowing the identification of the mak gene.
recently, this metabolite was proposed to be the intermediate in a pathway linking trehalose with the synthesis of glycogen in m. smegmatis.
this is the first mycobacterial mak to be characterized and its properties represent essential knowledge towards deeper understanding of mycobacterial physiology.
the enzyme was a monomer in solution, had maximal activity at 60Â°c, between ph  <dig> and  <dig>  and was unstable on ice and upon freeze/thawing.
