the results of this study showed changes in biomarkers related to the antioxidant status of dogs naturally infected with b. canis canis.
furthermore, this study detected more pronounced decrease in antioxidant biomarkers  in dogs with moderate anaemia compared to those with mild anaemia.
these biomarkers could be used as indicators of disease severity and outcome in dogs suffering from babesiosis.
additionally, the babesiosis group was divided according to the anaemia into non-anaemic, mildly anaemic, moderately anaemic and severely anaemic dogs.
the results of our study showed significantly decreased sod, catalase and tas values in diseased dogs compared to controls, while there were no significant differences in gpx between these groups.
superoxide dismutase, catalase and gpx were negatively correlated whereas mda was positively correlated with the lethal outcome of the disease.

for this purpose a profile consisting of four antioxidant biomarkers  and malondialdehyde - mda as an oxidant biomarker  were evaluated in dogs with canine babesiosis of different clinical severity and outcomes.
the aim of this study was to evaluate whether oxidative stress could be related to the severity and outcome of canine babesiosis.
to the authors’ knowledge there are no reports in which antioxidants have been analyzed in different presentations of canine babesiosis or in which the prognostic value of antioxidants has been studied.
canine babesiosis is caused by species of the babesia genus and has become an emerging disease worldwide.
