biochemical analyses showed adaptive changes in lipid and protein metabolism after the housing switch, whereas cortisol and muscular markers showed a large variability between animals.
housing of gilts in individual stalls and diet change increase lipid and protein catabolism, oxidative stress, activate the innate immune system and cause a certain degree of tissue damage.
both techniques showed alterations in two main homeostatic mechanisms: the innate immune and redox systems.
blood and saliva samples were collected a day before and up to four days after changing the housing system.
other proteins related to the innate immune system, including lactotransferrin, protegrin  <dig> and galectin  <dig> were also identified by itraq, as well as oxidative stress enzymes such as peroxiredoxin  <dig> and glutathione peroxidase  <dig>  proteomics also revealed the decrease of apolipoproteins, and the presence of intracellular proteins in serum, which may indicate physical injury to tissues.
we propose that valuable assays for stress assessment in gilts may be based on a score composed by a combination of salivary cortisol, lipid metabolites, innate immunity and oxidative stress markers and intracellular proteins.

in this work, we have analyzed the changes in serum composition in gilts after switching their housing, from pen to individual stalls, which is generally accepted to cause animal discomfort.
