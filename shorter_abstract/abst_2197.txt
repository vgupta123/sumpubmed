the role of micrornas  in the regulatory response of gift to s. iniae infection has been underestimated and has not yet been well studied.
seven target genes, which encode immune-related proteins  were predicted to play crucial roles in the gift response to s. iniae infection.
understanding the mirna transcriptome of s. iniae-infected gift is important for exploring the immune responses regulated by mirnas as well as for studying novel regulated networks to prevent and treat s. iniae infections in the future.
rnahybrid and targetscan were used to identify complementary mirna and mrna target sites, and the gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes databases were used to annotate and predict potential downstream regulation of biological pathways.
the expressions of these mirnas were verified by quantitative real-time pcr.
bioinformatics analysis identified  <dig> and  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> and  <dig> novel mirnas in the co and in libraries, respectively.
head kidney has an important immune function in teleost fishes.
the main aim of this study was to determine the possible function of mirnas in head kidney of s. iniae-infected gift.
high-throughput deep sequencing of two libraries  of rna extracted from gift head kidney tissues generated  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads.
genetically improved farmed tilapia  are susceptible to infection by streptococcus iniae when maintained in modern intensive culture systems.

mirnas are small, non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3’-untranslated regions of their target mrnas.
