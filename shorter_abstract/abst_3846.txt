clostridium difficile is the main cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea and colitis known as c. difficile-associated disease .with increased severity and failure of treatment in cdad, new approaches for prevention and treatment, such as the use of probiotics, are needed.
on the suppression of il- <dig> production in response to c. difficile infection.
we screened lactobacillus conditioned media from  <dig> infant fecal isolates for the ability to suppress c. difficile-induced il- <dig> production from ht- <dig> cells.
factors produced by two vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli, l. rhamnosus l <dig>  and l.casei l <dig> , suppressed the secretion and transcription of il- <dig> without inhibiting c. difficile viability or toxin production.
conditioned media from lr-l <dig> and lc-l <dig> also decreased the production of c. difficile-induced gm-csf in ht- <dig> cells.
our results suggest that l. rhamnosus l <dig> and l. casei l <dig> each produce factors capable of modulating inflammation stimulated by c. difficile.
these vancomycin-resistant lactobacillus strains are potential probiotics for treating or preventing cdad.
since the pathogenesis of cdad involves an inflammatory response with a massive influx of neutrophils recruited by interleukin - <dig>  this study aimed to investigate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus spp.
