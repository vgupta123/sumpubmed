upon cultivation of  <dig>  lines in multi-field trials and applying a genome-wide association study, eight major quantitative trait loci  were identified as main determinants to control flowering time in barley.
these qtl accounted for 64% of the cross-validated proportion of explained genotypic variance .

applying a whole genome prediction model including main effects and epistatic interactions allowed predicting flowering time with an unmatched accuracy of 77% of cross-validated pg.
we developed the first barley nested association mapping  population, heb- <dig>  by crossing  <dig> wild barleys with one elite barley cultivar, and used it to dissect the genetic architecture of flowering time.
the strongest single qtl effect corresponded to the known photoperiod response gene ppd-h <dig>  after sequencing the causative part of ppd-h <dig>  we differentiated twelve haplotypes in heb- <dig>  whereof the strongest exotic haplotype accelerated flowering time by 11 days compared to the elite barley haplotype.
in addition, our study confirms that the exotic biodiversity present in heb- <dig> is a valuable toolbox to dissect the genetic architecture of important agronomic traits and to replenish the elite barley breeding pool with favorable, trait-improving exotic alleles.
