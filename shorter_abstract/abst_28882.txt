in these cells, we determined jak/stat signaling promotes apt expression.
the niche of the drosophila testis is well-characterized and genetically tractable, making it ideal for investigating the molecular regulation of stem cell biology.
this study investigated the molecular regulation of the jak/stat pathway in the stem cells of the drosophila testis.
genetic analysis revealed that a conserved genetic regulatory network limits jak/stat activity in the somatic stem cells of drosophila testis.
we found apt functions as a negative feedback inhibitor of stat activity, which enables cyst cell maturation.
the jak/stat pathway, activated by signals from a niche component called the hub, maintains both germline and somatic stem cells.
we determined that the transcriptional regulator apontic  acts in the somatic  stem cells  to balance differentiation and maintenance.
