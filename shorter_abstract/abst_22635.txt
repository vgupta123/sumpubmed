the international comparative assessment of structure prediction , an "a posteriori" evaluation of the quality of theoretical models when the experimental structure becomes available, demonstrates that predictions can be successful as well as unsuccessful, and this suggests the necessity for evaluations able to discard "a priori" the wrong models.
these results were applied to develop an evaluation test of theoretical models based on the expected globular properties of proteins.
the best theoretical models, as judged by casp assessors, were in agreement with the expected properties, while most of the low-quality models had not passed our evaluations.
to verify the success of our test, we applied it to several protein models submitted to the sixth edition of casp.
the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of globular proteins is fundamental for a detailed investigation of their functional properties.
we analyzed different structural properties of globular proteins for experimentally solved proteins belonging to the four different structural classes: "mainly alpha", "mainly beta", "alpha/beta" and "alpha+beta".
our test allows the evaluation of models in the absence of experimental reference structures, thereby preventing the diffusion of incorrect structural models and the formulation of incorrect functional hypotheses.
