the probable enzymatic activity deduced from the detailed analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests that the pecace domain may proceed through a lt-type or goose lyzosyme-type cleavage mechanism.
the release of new bacterial genomes sequences will probably add new members to the five groups identified so far in this work, and new groups could also emerge.
the metabolism of bacterial peptidoglycan is a dynamic process, synthases and cleavage enzymes are functionally coordinated.
the pecace domain is, in some instances, found in association with other domains known to catalyze peptidoglycan hydrolysis.
a new domain, pecace, putatively involved in peptidoglycan hydrolysis has been identified in s. pneumoniae.
conversely, the functional characterization of the unknown domains mentioned in this work can now become easier, since bacterial peptidoglycan is proposed to be the substrate.
homology searches of the pneumococcal genome allowed the identification of a new domain putatively involved in peptidoglycan cleavage .
we report the identification of the first putative lt enzyme in s. pneumoniae and discuss its role in pneumococcal peptidoglycan metabolism.
the multimodular architecture of proteins containing the pecace domain is another example of the many activities harbored by peptidoglycan hydrolases, which is probably required for the regulation of peptidoglycan metabolism.
lts are also involved in peptidoglycan turnover and in macromolecular transport systems.
despite their central importance, no lts have been identified in the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae.
this sequence has been found exclusively in gram-positive bacteria and gene clusters containing pecace are conserved among streptococcal species.
