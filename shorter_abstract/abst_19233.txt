congenital stationary night-blindness  is a recessive autosomal defect in low-light vision in appaloosa and other horse breeds.
trpm <dig> is normally expressed in the on-bipolar cells of the inner nuclear layer of the retina.
down-regulation of trpm <dig> expression in csnb results from a transposon-like insertion in intron  <dig> of the trpm <dig> gene.
stop transcription signals in this transposon significantly reduce trpm <dig> primary transcript levels in csnb horses.
these finding suggest that the equine trpm <dig> snp can act independently to reduce survival of trpm <dig> mrna escaping the intron  <dig> transcriptional stop signals in csnb horses.
up-regulating nova- <dig> expression in primary cultures of choroidal melanocytes carrying the intron  <dig> snp caused an average log 2-fold reduction of ~ <dig>  of trpm <dig> mrna expression.
