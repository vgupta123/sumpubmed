at present, there is not a widely accepted consensus view regarding the phylogenetic structure of kingdom fungi although two major phyla, ascomycota and basidiomycota, are clearly delineated.
zygomycota, basidiomycota, and ascomycota form a monophyletic group separate from chytridiomycota.
using the translated amino acid sequences of the rpb <dig> and rpb <dig> genes, we have inferred a fungal phylogeny that consists largely of well-supported monophyletic phyla.
our major results, each with significant statistical support, are:  microsporidia are sister to kingdom fungi and are not members of zygomycota; that is, microsporidia and fungi originated from a common ancestor.
our results suggest that loss of the flagellum happened only once during early stages of fungal evolution; consequently, the majority of fungi, unlike plants and animals, are nonflagellated.
chytridiomycota, the only fungal phylum having a developmental stage with a flagellum, is paraphyletic and is the basal lineage.
microsporidia are not included within kingdom fungi; rather they are a sister-group to the fungi.
our study demonstrates the applicability of protein sequences from large, slowly-evolving genes to the derivation of well-resolved and highly supported phylogenies across long evolutionary distances.
microsporidia may or may not be fungi; the glomales  may or may not constitute a fifth fungal phylum, and the loss of the flagellum may have occurred either once or multiple times during fungal evolution.
