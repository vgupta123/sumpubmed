the rapid radiation of crested newts  comprises four morphotypes: 1) the t. karelinii group, 2) t. carnifex - t. macedonicus, 3) t. cristatus and 4) t. dobrogicus.
we argue that the bayesian full mitochondrial dna phylogeny is superior to previous attempts aiming to recover the crested newt species tree.
seen from the root of triturus , a basal dichotomy separates the t. karelinii group  from the remaining crested newts.
the split between the t. karelinii group and the three other morphotypes, at ca.
we here resolve the crested newt phylogeny by using complete mitochondrial genome sequences.
the next split divides the latter assortment into t. carnifex - t. macedonicus  versus t. cristatus  and t. dobrogicus .
<dig>  ma, splitting t. cristatus and t. dobrogicus.
bayesian inference based on the mitogenomic data yields a fully bifurcating, significantly supported tree, though maximum likelihood inference yields low support values.
the crested newt morphotypes differ in the duration of their annual aquatic period.
no currently known vicariant events can be ascribed to the other two splits, first at ca.
<dig>  ma, separating t. carnifex - t. macedonicus, and second at ca.
furthermore, our new phylogeny involves a maximally parsimonious interpretation of nrbv evolution.
the phylogenetic relationships of the morphotypes have not yet been settled, despite several previous attempts, employing a variety of molecular markers.
