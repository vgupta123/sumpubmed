analysis of the array data strongly implicates wnt signalling and the pitx family of transcription factors in the process of cornea to lens transdifferentiation.
here, we have used a functional transgenic approach to show that bmp signalling is required for lens regeneration and a microarray approach to identify genes that are upregulated specifically during this process.
our results strongly implicate the developmental wnt and bmp signalling pathways in the process of cornea to lens transdifferentiation  in xenopus, and suggest direct transdifferentiation between these two anterior eye tissues.
surgical removal of the lens from larval xenopus laevis results in a rapid transdifferention of central corneal cells to form a new lens.
pluripotency genes, in contrast, were not upregulated, supporting the idea that corneal cells transdifferentiate without returning to a stem cell state.
our analysis also captured several genes associated with congenital cataract in humans.
