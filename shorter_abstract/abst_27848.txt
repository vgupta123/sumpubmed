pseudomonas syringae is a widespread bacterial species that infects almost all major crops.
we compared virulence factors in these and other available genomes of phylogroup  <dig> to find genes responsible for the specialization of bacteria.
strain  <dig> has relatively recently changed its host plant to dicots.
in recent years, the damage caused by bacterial pathogens to major crops has been increasing worldwide.
different p. syringae strains use a wide range of biochemical mechanisms, including phytotoxins and effectors of the type iii and type iv secretion systems, which determine the specific nature of the pathogen virulence.
the results obtained by comparing the strain  <dig> genome with the genomes of bacteria infecting monocots can help to identify the genes that define specific nature of the virulence of p. syringae strains.
