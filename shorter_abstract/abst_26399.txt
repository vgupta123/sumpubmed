in this study, we attempted to demonstrate the feasibility of using  <dig> pyrosequencing to study genome diversity of dengue virus quasispecies by sequencing a pool of known dengue viral strains.
this study showed that  <dig> pyrosequencing, coupled with our analysis procedure, could sequence the whole genome of dengue virus with good coverage.
poor proofreading by rna polymerase during its replication results in the accumulation of mutations in its genome.
frequencies of known strains detected from each data set were highly correlated with the input ratios.
the reads covered the whole genome without any gaps, and the minimum coverage depth was 50Ã—.
