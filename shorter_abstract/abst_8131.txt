they also raise interesting questions about the relation between gtpase activity of sup <dig> and its essential function in yeast.
we also show that this residue is involved in functional interaction between the n- and c-domains of the protein.
our results point to a new critical residue involved in the translation termination activity of sup <dig> and in functional interaction between the n- and c-domains of the protein.
both mutant proteins showed a large decrease of gtpase activity and a reduced interaction with erf1/sup45p.
