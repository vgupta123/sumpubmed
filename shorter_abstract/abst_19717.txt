a wheat psy <dig> promoter region was also investigated for the presence of cis-acting elements involved in the response to abscisic acid , since carotenoids also play an important role as precursors of signalling molecules devoted to plant development and biotic/abiotic stress responses.
psy are nuclear enzymes encoded by a small gene family consisting of three paralogous genes  that have been widely characterized in rice, maize and sorghum.
in wheat, for which yellow pigment content is extremely important for flour colour, only psy <dig> has been extensively studied because of its association with qtls reported for yellow pigment whereas psy <dig> has been partially characterized.
expression of wheat psys in leaves and roots was investigated during aba treatment to confirm the up-regulation of psy <dig> during abiotic stress.
we investigated the structural and functional determinisms of psy genes in wheat.
more generally, among eudicots and monocots, the psy gene family was found to be associated with differences in gene copy numbers, allowing us to propose an evolutionary model for the entire psy gene family in grasses.
