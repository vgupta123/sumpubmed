autosomal dominant optic atrophy , a form of progressive bilateral blindness due to loss of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve deterioration, arises predominantly from mutations in the nuclear gene for the mitochondrial gtpase, opa <dig>  opa <dig> localizes to mitochondrial cristae in the inner membrane where electron transport chain complexes are enriched.
while opa <dig> has been characterized for its role in mitochondrial cristae structure and organelle fusion, possible effects of opa <dig> on mitochondrial function have not been determined.
results suggest that the nuclear dna mutations that give rise to adoa in our patient population do not alter mitochondrial electron transport.
mitochondria from six adoa patients bearing opa <dig> mutations and ten adoa patients with unidentified gene mutations were studied for respiratory capacity and electron transport complex function.
