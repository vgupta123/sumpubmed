we identified almost  <dig>  snps in wild mallards that will likely yield good results in genotyping.
in the ~ <dig>  snps we found a subset of ~ <dig>  snps shared between wild mallards and the sequenced domesticated duck suggesting a low genetic divergence.
the correlation of the minor allele count and observed minor allele frequency in the snp discovery pool was  <dig> .
more than one billion base pairs of sequence information were generated resulting in a 16Ã— coverage of a reduced representation library of the mallard genome.
the mallard is, besides a species of large agricultural and societal importance, also the focal species when it comes to long distance dispersal of avian influenza.
approximately  <dig>  snps identified within our data were shared with snps identified in the sequenced domestic duck or in est sequencing projects.
next generation sequencing technologies allow to obtain at low cost the genomic sequence information that currently lacks for most economically and ecologically important organisms.
for large scale identification of snps we performed illumina sequencing of wild mallard dna and compared our data with ongoing genome and est sequencing of domesticated conspecifics.
in addition, almost  <dig>  nucleotide positions on the domesticated duck reference showed a different nucleotide compared to wild mallard.
of these, ~ <dig>  snps were detected within our wild mallard sequences and ~ <dig>  were detected between wild and domesticated duck data.
sequence reads were aligned to a draft domesticated duck reference genome and allowed for the detection of over  <dig>  snps within our mallard sequence dataset.
