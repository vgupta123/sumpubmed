most of these are multimeric complexes, which are made of non-symmetric monomers arranged in a symmetric manner.
many functional proteins have a symmetric structure.
however, there are also a large number of proteins that have a symmetric structure in the monomeric state.
the symd procedure works by comparing the structure to its own copy after the copy is circularly permuted by all possible number of residues.
most algorithms that detect the internally symmetric proteins depend on finding repeating units of similar structure and do not use the symmetry information.
we also report an initial, overall view of the types of symmetries and symmetric folds that occur in the protein domain structure universe.
these internally symmetric proteins are interesting objects from the point of view of their folding, function, and evolution.
