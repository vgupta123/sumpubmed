the biodiversity databases in korea have been scattered among several institutes and local natural history museums with incompatible data types.
currently, twelve institutes and museums in korea are integrated by the digir  protocol, with darwin core <dig>  format as its metadata standard for data exchange.
naris aims to be integral in maximizing bio-resource utilization for conservation, management, research, education, industrial applications, and integration with other bioinformation data resources.
on-line biodiversity information databases are growing quickly and being integrated into general bioinformatics systems due to the advances of fast gene sequencing technologies and the internet.
therefore, a comprehensive database and a nation wide web portal for biodiversity information is necessary in order to integrate diverse information resources, including molecular and genomic databases.
the korean natural history research information system  was built and serviced as the central biodiversity information system to collect and integrate the biodiversity data of various institutes and natural history museums in korea.
a korean data portal, naris, has been developed to efficiently manage and utilize biodiversity data, which includes genetic resources.
in particular, integrating molecular and genetic information from the national center for biotechnology information  databases with naris was recently accomplished.
