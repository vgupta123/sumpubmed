the decrease in the energetically costly inflammatory response of birds experiencing high bacterial load suggests a trade-off between investment in preen secretion and immunity and reinforces the idea that feather microbiota may have a strong impact on the ecology and evolution of the avian host.
to shed light on how birds balance the trade-off between immunity and preen secretions when facing high or low feather bacterial load, we experimentally manipulated feather bacteria load of feral pigeons , and investigated the effects on immune defenses.
birds facing high feather bacterial load had lower immune response to pha skin-swelling test  than controls, while birds facing low feather bacterial load had higher blood bacterial killing ability  than controls.
no other components of the immune system  were found to be affected by feather bacterial load.
pigeons had previously been shown to adjust preening to feather bacterial load.
the immune system is only triggered when bacteria gain access into the body.
preening is, however, costly and may trade-off with investment in the immune system.
