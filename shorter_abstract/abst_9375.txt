the estimated genome size is  <dig>  gb which represents a high degree of completeness, with 95% of the available est sequences found in assembled contigs.
the assembly method combines the bac plus wgs local assembly used for the rat and sea urchin with the whole genome shotgun  only assembly used for many other animal genomes including the rhesus macaque.
the assembly process consisted of multiple phases: first, bacs were assembled with bac generated sequence, then subsequently in combination with the individual overlapping wgs reads.
we present here the assembly of the bovine genome.
the biological analysis of this bovine genome assembly is being published, and the sequence data is available to support future bovine research.
the two assemblies were combined to create a more complete genome representation that retained the high quality bac-based local assembly information, but with gaps between bacs filled in with the wgs-only assembly.
