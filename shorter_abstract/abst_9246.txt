in this study, we subjected soluble mycelial proteins to proteolysis followed by 2d lc maldi-ms/ms.
comparison with a 6-frame translation of the s. nodorum genome assembly confirmed  <dig> existing gene annotations  and provided evidence supporting  <dig> genes with coding exon frameshift modifications,  <dig> genes with extensions of coding exons into annotated introns or untranslated regions ,  <dig> new gene annotations which were supported by tblastn to nr, and  <dig> potential new genes residing within un-assembled regions of the genome.
stagonospora nodorum, a fungal ascomycete in the class dothideomycetes, is a damaging pathogen of wheat.
comparison of the detected peptides with the gene models validated  <dig> genes.
statistical analysis of the validated gene models revealed a preponderance of cytoplasmic and nuclear localised proteins, and proteins with intracellular-associated go terms.
