for accuracy in navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation , determination of the hotspot location of small hand muscles is crucial because it is the basis for the resting motor threshold  and, therefore, its spatial resolution.
intraobserver variability had a mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm   <dig>  to  <dig>  mm), whereas mean interobserver variability was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm .
overall, intraobserver variability showed higher reliability than interobserver variability.

our findings show that we can achieve good reliability in hotspot determination, ranging within the calculated precision of the system.
ten subjects underwent ntms motor mapping of the hotspot for the abductor pollicis brevis muscle  three times.
the first two sessions were performed by the same examiner; the third mapping was performed by a different examiner.
