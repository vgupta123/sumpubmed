because it has been difficult to detect an effect of hypoxia on skp <dig> hydroxylation itself, the role of skp <dig> modification was investigated in a submerged model of dictyostelium development dependent on atmospheric hyperoxia.
in dictyostelium, genetic studies show that hydroxylation of skp <dig> by phya, and subsequent glycosylation of the hydroxyproline, is required for normal oxygen sensing during multicellular development at an air/water interface.
a divergence between the animal and protist mechanisms is the enzymatic target: the animal transcriptional factor subunit hypoxia inducible factor-α whose hydroxylation results in its poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and the protist e3scfubiquitin ligase subunit skp <dig> whose hydroxylation might control the stability of other proteins.
analysis of mutants showed that cyst formation was inhibited by high skp <dig> levels via a hydroxylation-dependent mechanism, and spore differentiation required core glycosylation of skp <dig> by a mechanism that could be bypassed by excess skp <dig>  failure of spores to differentiate at lower oxygen correlated qualitatively with reduced skp <dig> hydroxylation.
in static isotropic conditions beneath 70-100% atmospheric oxygen, amoebae formed radially symmetrical cyst-like aggregates consisting of a core of spores and undifferentiated cells surrounded by a cortex of stalk cells.
