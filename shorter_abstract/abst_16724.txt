we verified that these differences can not simply be attributed to the generally higher sequence identity of the ortholog-ortholog and the inparalog-inparalog pairs.
also pairs of inparalogs were found to have a higher ipc score than inparalog-closest non-inparalog pairs.
therefore, we wanted to investigate whether orthologs have a higher degree of intron position conservation  compared to non-orthologous sequences that are equally similar in sequence.
furthermore, we analyzed the agreement between ipc score and the ortholog score assigned by the inparanoid algorithm, and found that it was consistently high for all species comparisons.
as a consequence, our ipc score is useful as an additional discriminating factor when assigning orthology.
they were enriched for functions important for multicellularity, which implies a connection between shifts in intronic structure and the origin of multicellularity.
for comparison, we also gathered the closest non-orthologs, meaning sequences close in sequence space, yet falling just outside the ortholog cluster.
therefore, correct elucidation of the evolutionary relationships among genes is a critical task, and attempts should be made to further improve the phylogenetic inference by adding relevant discriminating features.
to this end, we developed a new score for ipc and applied it to ortholog groups between human and six other species.
we found that ortholog-ortholog gene pairs on average have a significantly higher degree of ipc compared to ortholog-closest non-ortholog pairs.
for this reason, it could be possible to use conservation of intron positions as a discriminating factor when assigning orthology.
we conclude that orthologous genes tend to have more conserved intron positions compared to non-orthologous genes.
