expression profiling of macrophages infected with transgenic l. mexicana revealed consistently higher levels of gata- <dig> and socs- <dig> transcripts, both associated with the th2-type response observed in in vivo filarial infection.
we have addressed this question by testing the immunological function of novel genes from helminth parasites, in which conventional transgenesis is not yet possible.
parasites exploit sophisticated strategies to evade host immunity that require both adaptation of existing genes and evolution of new gene families.
expression of alt proteins, but not a truncated mutant, conferred greater infectivity of macrophages in vitro, reaching 3-fold higher parasite densities.
leishmania transfection is a tractable and informative approach to determining immunological functions of single genes from heterologous organisms.
we investigated two such novel genes from brugia malayi termed abundant larval transcript , expression of which reaches ~5% of total transcript at the time parasites enter the human host.
to test the hypothesis that alt proteins modulate host immunity, we adopted an alternative transfection strategy to express these products in the protozoan parasite leishmania mexicana.
in the case of the filarial alt proteins, our data suggest that they may participate in the th <dig> bias observed in the response to parasite infection by modulating cytokine-induced signalling within immune system cells.
