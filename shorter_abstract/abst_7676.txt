to confirm this hypothesis, we launched a study to determine the global gene expression profiles in three immune competent organs of cecropin p <dig> transgenic rainbow trout by using a 44k salmonid microarray.
these fish exhibit resistance characteristic to infection by aeromonas salmonicida and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus .
these genes may serve as markers for selective breeding of rainbow trout or other aquaculture important fish species bearing traits of disease resistance.
the identified genes involved in different pathways related to immune function are valuable indicators associated with enhanced host immunity.
from the microarray data, a total of  <dig> genes in the spleen,  <dig> in the kidney, and  <dig> in the liver were determined as differentially expressed genes  in the cecropin p <dig> transgenic rainbow trout when compared to the non-transgenics.
the gene product of cecropin p <dig> transgene produced in the disease resistant transgenic rainbow trout not only can kill the pathogens directly but also exert multifaceted immunomodulatory properties to boost host immunity.
perturbation of other biological functions that might contribute indirectly to host immunity was also observed.
enrichment analyses conducted by two different bioinformatics tools revealed a tissue specific profile of functional pathway perturbation.
therefore, we hypothesized that in addition to the direct antimicrobial activity of cecropin p <dig> in the disease resistant transgenic rainbow trout, this antimicrobial peptide may also affect the expression of immune relevant genes in the host.
we have recently developed several homozygous families of transgenic rainbow trout harbouring cecropin p <dig> transgene.
