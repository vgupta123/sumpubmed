three empirical bayes methods  were the most effective statistical tests across simulated and both 2-colour cdna and affymetrix experimental data.
all three empirical bayes methods assessed in our study are good choices for statistical tests for small n microarray studies for both affymetrix and cdna data.
this can lead to poor random error estimates and inaccurate statistical tests of differential expression.
we compare the performance of the standard t-test, fold change, and four small n statistical test methods designed to circumvent these problems.
microarray studies often have small samples sizes, however, due to cost constraints or specimen availability.
the generalized log transformation was shown to be beneficial in improving results with certain data sets, in particular high variance cdna data.
the local pooled error  test introduced a bias that lowered false positive rates below theoretically expected values and had lower power relative to the top performers.
we report results of various normalization methods for empirical microarray data and of various random error models for simulated data.
pre-processing of data influences performance and the proper combination of pre-processing and statistical testing is necessary for obtaining the best results.
the cybert regularized t-statistic in particular was able to maintain expected false positive rates with simulated data showing high variances at low gene intensities, although at the cost of low true positive rates.
