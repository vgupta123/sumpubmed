an epcam-specific chimeric antigen receptor  was constructed to transduce human peripheral blood lymphocytes  and thereby enable them to target the csc marker epcam.
to investigate the therapeutic capabilities of pbls expressing epcam-specific cars, we used two different tumor models, pc <dig>  the human prostate cancer cell line, which has low expression levels of epcam, and pc3m, a highly metastatic clone of pc <dig> that has high expression levels of epcam.
despite the low expression of epcam on pc <dig> cells, car-expressing pbls significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival in a pc <dig> metastasis model, probably by targeting the highly proliferative and metastatic population of cancer cells.
our data demonstrate that pbls expressing with epcam-specific cars have significant anti-tumor activity against prostate cancer.
because cancer stem cells  play an important role in tumor growth and metastasis, we hypothesized that adoptive transfer of t cells targeting a csc antigen could result in dramatic anti-tumor effects.
we demonstrate that car-expressing pbls can kill pc3m tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.

therefore, the adoptive transfer of t cells targeting epcam could have great potential as a cancer treatment.
