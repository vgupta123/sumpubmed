it achieves a good diversity in the obtained pareto front, and rapid convergence.
the mined patterns present a significant biological relevance in terms of related biological processes, components and molecular functions in a species-independent manner.
the microarray datasets are usually presented in 2d matrices, where rows represent genes and columns represent experimental conditions.
in this work we present the cmopsob , a novel clustering approach for microarray datasets to cluster genes and conditions highly related in sub-portions of the microarray data.
the proposed cmopsob algorithm is successfully applied to biclustering of microarray dataset.
therefore, it is a useful tool to analyze large microarray datasets.
high-throughput microarray technologies have generated and accumulated massive amounts of gene expression datasets that contain expression levels of thousands of genes under hundreds of different experimental conditions.
in the meantime, the nearest neighbour search strategies based on crowding distance and Ïµ-dominance can rapidly converge to the pareto front and guarantee diversity of solutions.
in the medical domain, these patterns are useful for understanding various diseases, and aid in more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, treatment planning, as well as drug discovery.
we compare the potential of this methodology with other biclustering algorithms by analyzing two common and public datasets of gene expression profiles.
