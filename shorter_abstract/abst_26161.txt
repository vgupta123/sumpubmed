indeval can find multiple variable regions simultaneously  and display user-selected messages specific to the sequence variants found.
the program indeval was originally developed to help researchers find known regions of insertion/deletion activity  in newly determined poaceae trnl-f sequences and compare them with  <dig> previously determined sequences.
a variable region is any specific sequence fragment of interest, such as an indel region, a codon or codons, or sequence coding for a particular rna secondary structure.
it is supplied with input files designed for this purpose.
the program's sensitivity to different levels of nucleotide and/or length variation in conserved regions can be adjusted.
additional files contain the variable regions and user-defined messages about the sequence found within them .
variable regions are found by determining the position of flanking sequence  using the lpam  algorithm.
once the user is satisfied with the organization of the display, the information can be exported to an annotated text file.
more broadly, the program is applicable for finding specific target regions  in dna sequence.
indeval input is dna sequence and a template file .
