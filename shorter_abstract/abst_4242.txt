specifically, we study metabolic genotypes whose phenotype is viability in minimal chemical environments that differ in their sole carbon sources.
different carbon sources differ in the number of metabolic genotypes in their genotype network; this number decreases as a genotype is required to be viable on increasing numbers of carbon sources, but much less than if metabolic reactions were used independently across different chemical environments.
our work shows that phenotype-preserving genotype networks have generic organizational properties and that these properties are insensitive to the number of reactions in metabolic genotypes.
a metabolic genotype comprises all chemical reactions an organism can catalyze via enzymes encoded in its genome.
the robustness of metabolic phenotypes to random reaction removal in such spaces has a narrow distribution with a high mean.
we show that regardless of the number of reactions in a metabolic genotype, the genotypes of a given phenotype typically form vast, connected, and unstructured sets -- genotype networks -- that nearly span the whole of genotype space.
previous work has focused on the properties of individual genotypes while little is known about how genome-scale metabolic networks with a given function can vary in their reaction content.
we here characterize spaces of such genotypes.
