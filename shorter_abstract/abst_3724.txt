the solexa genome analyzer, a next-generation sequencing platform, allows millions of short sequencing reads to be obtained with great accuracy, allowing for the ability to study the dynamics of the bacterial population at the whole genome level.
for particular bacterial strains, genhtr relies on a set of solexa short reads on given bacteria pathogens and their isogenic reference genome to identify heterogeneity sites, the chromosomal positions with multiple variants of genes in the bacterial population, and variations that occur in large gene families.
although it is much more time-consuming when compared to maq, a popular tool for snp analysis, genhtr is able to predict potential multiple variants that pre-exist in the bacterial population as well as snps that occur in the highly duplicated gene families.
the heterogeneity results in non-synonymous and nonsense mutations, leading to truncated proteins for both lysr and muts.
the result of the below-species-level evolution is heterogeneity, where populations consist of subpopulations with a large number of structural variations.
heterogeneity analysis is thus essential to our understanding of how selective and neutral forces shape bacterial populations over a short period of time.
the tool referred to as genhtr was developed for genome-wide heterogeneity analysis.
genhtr was developed for genome-wide heterogeneity analysis.
usa <dig> cell line, and demonstrated that it could predict such multiple variants.
they include multiple variants of genes critical in pathogenesis, e.g.
microevolution is the study of short-term changes of alleles within a population and their effects on the phenotype of organisms.
genes encoding a lysr family transcriptional regulator,  <dig> s ribosomal rna, and dna mismatch repair protein muts.
genhtr accomplishes this by building and comparatively analyzing genome-wide heterogeneity genotypes for both the newly sequenced genomes  and their isogenic reference .
