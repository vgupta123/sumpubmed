using genomeviz, data deriving from studies on genomic islands, gene/protein classifications, gc content, gc skew, whole genome alignments, microarrays and proteomics may be plotted.
genomeviz should allow researchers to perform visualization and comparative analysis of up to eight different microbial genomes simultaneously.
an increasing number of microbial genomes are being sequenced and deposited in public databases.
these exercises have necessitated the requirement for visualizing microbial genomes and performing genome comparisons on a finer scale.
we have developed genomeviz to enable rapid visualization and subsequent comparisons of several microbial genomes in an interactive environment.
here we describe a program that allows visualization of both qualitative and quantitative information from complete and partially sequenced microbial genomes.
