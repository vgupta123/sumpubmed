expansion and divergence of the pdcd <dig> gene family occurred during land plant evolution with the appearance of a distinct gene member following the evolution of basal angiosperms.
the programmed cell death  <dig>  protein is induced in animals during apoptosis and functions to inhibit translation and tumor promoter-induced neoplastic transformation.
the appearance of a unique form of pdcd <dig> in plants correlates with the appearance of components of the ethylene signaling pathway, suggesting that it may represent the adaptation of an existing protein involved in programmed cell death to one that functions in abiotic stress responses through hormone signaling.
pdcd <dig> in more recently evolved chlorophytes also contains four ma <dig> domains but this may have resulted from an independent duplication event.
in older algal lineages, pdcd <dig> contains two ma <dig> domains similar to the homolog in animals.
by the appearance of early land plants, however, pdcd <dig> is composed of four ma <dig> domains which likely is the result of a duplication of the two ma <dig> domain form of the protein.
although eif4a is an atp-dependent rna helicase that binds the ma <dig> domain of eif4g to promote translation initiation, binding of eif4a to the ma <dig> domains of pdcd <dig> inhibits protein synthesis.
evidence from fresh water algae, from which land plants evolved, suggests that the duplication event occurred prior to the colonization of land.
