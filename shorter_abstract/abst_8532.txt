we then used filodetect to assess the role of a lipid kinase on filopodia production in breast cancer cells.
also, increases in filopodia number or size are characteristic of many invasive cancers and are correlated with increased rates of metastasis in mouse experiments.
experimental results show that pi4kiii β expression leads to an increase in filopodia number and length, suggesting that pi4kiii β is involved in driving filopodia production.
here, we present filodetect, an automated tool for detecting, counting and measuring the length of filopodia in fluorescence microscopy images.
filodetect provides accurate and objective quantification of filopodia in microscopy images, and will enable large scale comparative studies to assess the effects of different genetic and chemical perturbations on filopodia production in different cell types, including cancer cell lines.
the method first segments the cell from the background, using a modified triangle threshold method, and then extracts the filopodia using a series of morphological operations.
we verified the accuracy of filodetect on rat <dig> and b16f <dig> cell images from three different labs, showing that per-cell filopodia counts and length estimates are highly correlated with the manual annotations.
manual detection is a significant barrier to the discovery and quantification of new factors that influence the filopodia system.
