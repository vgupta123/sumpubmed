we show that unassembled reads as short as  <dig> bp can be used for the taxonomic classification of a metagenome.
carma is a new software pipeline for the characterisation of species composition and the genetic potential of microbial samples using short, unassembled reads.
metagenomics is a new field of research on natural microbial communities.
in this paper, we introduce webcarma, a refined version of carma available as a web application for the taxonomic and functional classification of unassembled short reads from metagenomic communities.
the web application is freely available at http://webcarma.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de.
