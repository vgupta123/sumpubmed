recently, many leaf color genotypes have been developed during tea plant breeding and have become valuable materials in the processing of green tea.
in comparison with longjing  <dig> , a widely planted green tea cultivar, zh <dig> exhibited the chlorina phenotype and displayed significantly decreased chlorophyll contents.
although the physiological characteristics of some leaf color mutants of tea plants have been partially revealed, little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to the chlorina phenotype in tea plants.
this study provides further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotype of the chlorina cultivar of camellia sinensis.
changes in the expression of genes involved in these pathways might be responsible for the different phenotype of zh <dig>
biochemical characteristics were analyzed and gene expression profiling was performed using a custom oligonucleotide-based microarray.

transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the ultrastructure of the chloroplasts was disrupted, and the grana were poorly stacked in zh <dig>  moreover, the contents of theanine and free amino acids were significantly higher, whereas the contents of carotenoids, catechins and anthocyanin were lower in zh <dig> than in lj <dig>  microarray analysis showed that the expression of  <dig> genes related to amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis and pigment metabolism was significantly altered in zh <dig> shoots compared with those of lj <dig> plants.
the tea plant  o. kuntze) is one of the most economically important woody crops.
the yellow-leaf tea cultivar zhonghuang  <dig>  was selected during tea plant breeding.
a novel chlorophyll-deficient chlorina tea plant cultivar was identified.
