a fuzzy logic-based procedure also confirmed the relatively poor performance of the wizard/biscuit combination.
the validity of this assumption has to be proved on the basis of specific performance criteria.
when performance criteria were applied , the independence of gmo quantification from the extraction method and matrix was statistically proved, except in the case of wizard applied to biscuit.
different dna extraction modules , were used to extract dna from different food/feed matrices  containing the target of the real-time pcr module used for validation.
purity and structural integrity  were used as basic criteria that a dna extraction module must satisfy in order to provide suitable template dna for quantitative real-time  pcr-based gmo analysis.
the modular approach to analysis of genetically modified organisms  relies on the independence of the modules combined .
