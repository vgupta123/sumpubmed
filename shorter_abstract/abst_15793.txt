to extract those representative solutions from the docking output datafile, we have developed an unsupervised and automatic clustering application, named dockanalyse.
dockanalyse makes the interpretation of the docking solutions through graphical and visual representations easier by guiding the user to find the representative solutions.
in some cases, as in a multimeric protein complex, several interaction regions are possible among the monomers.
these dynamic processes involve interactions with surface displacements between the proteins to finally achieve the functional configuration of the protein complex.
