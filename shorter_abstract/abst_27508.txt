we have successfully and repeatedly induced metamorphosis of y-larvae into a novel, highly reduced juvenile stage by applying the crustacean molting hormone 20-he.
from our observations on live and preserved material we conclude that adult facetotecta are endoparasitic in still to be identified marine hosts and with a juvenile stage that represents a remarkable convergence to that seen in parasitic barnacles .
however, despite intense efforts, the adult y-organism has never been identified, and nothing is therefore known about its biology.
