up-regulation of these  <dig> lncrnas after mi was confirmed by quantitative pcr in an independent validation group of  <dig> mi and  <dig> sham-operated mice .
adult male c57/bl <dig> mice were subjected to coronary ligation or sham operation.
in a time-course analysis involving  <dig> additional mi mice, the expression of both lncrnas peaked 24 hours after mi and returned to baseline after 2 days.
in situ hybridization revealed an up-regulation of mirt <dig> expression in the left ventricle of mi mice.
among these,  <dig> lncrnas, called myocardial infarction-associated transcript  <dig>  and  <dig> , showed robust up-regulation in the mi group: 5-fold and 13-fold, respectively.
lncrnas regulate gene expression, thus having the possibility to modulate disease progression.
in a derivation group of  <dig> mi and  <dig> sham-operated mice sacrificed 24 hours after surgery, microarray analysis showed that mi was associated with up-regulation of  <dig> lncrnas and down-regulation of  <dig> lncrnas .
mice with high level of expression of mirt <dig> and mirt <dig> had a preserved ejection fraction.
in this study, we investigated the changes of lncrnas expression in the heart after myocardial infarction .
myocardial infarction induces important changes in the expression of lncrnas in the heart.
