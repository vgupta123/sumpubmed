finally,  <dig> stable linkage groups were set for the  <dig> populations; the azalea chromosome number being  <dig>  a combination of regression mapping  and multipoint-likelihood maximization  enabled the construction of  <dig> maps and their alignment.
the alignment of the  <dig> maps on the basis of framework markers will facilitate in turn the alignment of qtl regions detected in each of the populations.
the different steps taken for map optimization and integration into a reference framework map for qtl mapping are discussed.
aflp and ssr markers are used as a reference backbone and functional markers  were added as candidate genes for qtl analysis.
an integrated framework map on four individual linkage maps in rhododendron simsii hybrids was constructed.
the approach we took is thoroughly different than the recently published integrated maps and well-suited for mapping in a non-model crop.
in the breeding program, flower color is the main feature for selection, only in later stages cultivation related plant quality traits are evaluated.
the inheritance of flower color has been well studied; information on the heritability of cultivation related quality traits is lacking.
for this purpose, qtl mapping in diverse genetic backgrounds appeared to be a must and therefore  <dig> mapping populations were made and analyzed.
for genotyping, mainly dominant scored aflp  and myb-based markers  were combined with co-dominant ssr  and est markers .
linkage groups were estimated in joinmap.
a large portion of loci  was common to at least two populations and could therefore serve as bridging markers.
