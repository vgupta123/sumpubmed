long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were shown to bind the cyp <dig> protein using a spectroscopic spin-shift assay, but alkanes did not bind.
alkanes have been hypothesized to act as universal inducers of bacterial cytochrome p <dig> gene expression.
hexane, octane and dodecane were toxic and induced substantial changes in membrane morphology.
hexadecane treatments resulted in a two-fold increase in mrna, and a four-fold increase in p <dig> protein levels relative to control cultures.
hexadecane treatment was an effective inducer of cyp <dig> expression in cyanobacteria.
we also monitored the binding of potential substrates to the p <dig> protein and explored the distribution of p <dig> protein in vegetative cells and nitrogen-fixing heterocysts using immuno-electron microscopy.
cyp <dig> protein was detected in vegetative cells but not in differentiated heterocysts where nitrogen fixation occurs.
