secondly, the analysis of the utilized h5n <dig> neuraminidase datasets at macro and micro levels has clearly indicated a pattern of spatial clustering of the h5n <dig> viral isolates based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host range based clustering.
as a proof of concept, the designed workflows are used for the phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase of h5n <dig> isolates  and influenza viruses .
secondly, the analysis of neuraminidase on different levels of complexity provides valuable insights of this virus's tendency for geographical based clustering in the phylogenetic tree and also shows the importance of glycan sites in its molecular evolution.
comparative phyloinformatics can be used to monitor, analyze, and possibly predict the evolution of viruses.
this has so far hindered the use of comparative phyloinformatics as a commonly applied tool in this area.
in this paper the graphical-oriented workflow design system called quascade and its efficient usage for comparative phyloinformatics are presented.
the results of this paper are hence twofold.
the current study demonstrates the efficiency and utility of workflow systems providing a biologist friendly approach to complex biological dataset analysis using high performance computing.
