analysis of these genes by inference from the fly database  revealed that these genes encode proteins with diverse functions, including cell signaling, gene transcription, dna/rna binding, ion trafficking, proteolysis-peptidolysis, metabolism, cytoskeleton formation, immune response and cell-adhesion.
twenty eight genes randomly selected from the microarray-identified list were verified by real time pcr  which supported the microarray data.
temporal response studies of  <dig> identified and verified genes by qpcr revealed that the temporal expression patterns of these genes are consistent with the microarray data.
temporal analysis of  <dig> verified genes revealed that the expression of these genes was indeed induced by bursicon and correlated well with the cuticle sclerotization process.
bursicon is a heterodimer neuropeptide responsible for regulating cuticle sclerotization and wing expansion in several insect species.
the composite data suggest that these genes play important roles in regulating the cuticle sclerotization and wing expansion processes.
recent studies indicate that the action of bursicon is mediated by a specific g protein-coupled receptor dlgr <dig> and the camp/pka signaling pathway.
