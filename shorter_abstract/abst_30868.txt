calcium influx induced by a calcium ionophore in primary human endothelial cells caused cross-linking of endogenous bcr, which was inhibited by the tg <dig> inhibitor cystamine.
since tg <dig> has transglutaminase activity that has been implicated in the response to extreme stress, we investigated if bcr can also act as a substrate for tg <dig>
bcr thus represents both an interacting partner under non-stressed conditions and a target of transglutaminase activity for tg <dig> during extreme stress.
treatment of cells with cobalt chloride, a hypoxia-mimetic that causes cellular stress, also generated high molecular weight bcr complexes.
cross-linked bcr protein appeared in the tritonx-100-insoluble cell fraction and further accumulated in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor.
abr, a protein related to bcr but lacking its n-terminal oligomerization domain, was not cross-linked by tg <dig> even though it forms a complex with it.
