metabotropic glutamate receptors  are class c g protein coupled receptors with widespread central nervous system expression.
mglur <dig> is a member of this family that has been implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes, but the very low potency of mglur <dig> for glutamate, its natural ligand, raise questions about the nature of its physiological role.
here, evidence is presented using heterologous expression in sympathetic neurons from the rat superior cervical ganglion  and modulation of the native scg calcium currents as an assay for receptor signaling, that mglur <dig> exhibits constitutive activity.
these findings introduce a novel potential physiological role for mglur <dig> in the nervous system, that of a constitutively active receptor, and thereby suggest a model in which mglur <dig> signaling may be impactful without the need to invoke strong receptor activation by millimolar concentrations of extracellular glutamate.
constitutive activity of mglur <dig> may be eliminated or reduced by the presence of other group iii mglurs, perhaps due to heterodimer formation.
further, this basal channel modulation was reversibly inhibited with the mglur <dig> inverse agonist mmpip.
finally, the selective mglur <dig> agonist -ppg was also able to act as an inverse agonist at mglur <dig>
in addition, both mmpip and ppg acted as inverse agonists at mglur <dig>  and agonists at mglur <dig>
