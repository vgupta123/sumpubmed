further comparative analysis revealed two regions expected to be important for protein function: a central, divalent metal ion binding pore, and a highly conserved elbow shaped helical region at the c-terminus.
the cellular functions of these actinobacteria-specific proteins  are not known.
here we report the first characterization of one of the  <dig> actinobacteria-specific proteins, asp <dig>  from streptomyces coelicolor.
our structural data in combination with sequence analysis supports the idea that two of the  <dig> actinobacteria-specific proteins, asp <dig> and asp <dig>  mediate similar function.
recent comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> actinobacterial species determined that only  <dig> genes of unknown function uniquely define this large phylum  <cit> .
our results suggest that this function could involve divalent metal ion binding/transport.
the actinobacteria phylum represents one of the largest and most diverse groups of bacteria, encompassing many important and well-characterized organisms including streptomyces, bifidobacterium, corynebacterium and mycobacterium.
the x-ray crystal structure of asp <dig> was determined at  <dig>  Çº. the overall structure of asp <dig> retains a similar fold to the large np- <dig> family of nucleoside phosphorylase enzymes; however, the function is not related.
