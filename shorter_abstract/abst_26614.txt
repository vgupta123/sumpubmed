about 14% of ecori bess and about 8% of bamhi bess were paired-end clones with unique sequences at both ends.
repeat-sequence analysis revealed that the abundance of lines might be due to a gc bias of the restriction sites and that the gc content of silkworm lines was higher than that of mammalian lines.
more than  <dig> bac end sequences , comprising more than  <dig> mbp and covering about  <dig> % of the silkworm genome, were sequenced.
the genbank accession numbers of the obtained end sequences are de283657â€“de <dig>
we performed large-scale bacterial artificial chromosome  end-sequencing of two bac libraries  and conducted an in silico analysis to characterize the obtained sequence data, to make them a useful resource for genomic research on the silkworm .
as a result of this characterization, the identified bess will be a valuable resource for genomic research on bombyx mori, for example, as a base for construction of a bac-based physical map.
the use of multiple complementary bac libraries constructed with different restriction enzymes also makes the bess a more valuable genomic resource.
repeat-sequence analysis with known repeat sequences indicated that the long interspersed nuclear elements  were abundant in bamhi bess, whereas dna-type elements were abundant in ecori bess.
