results from these experiments were validated in a human experimental setting using whole blood and purified cd4+ tcells.
pma/cd <dig> stimulation enhances a th1-like response in an lck and pkcθ dependent fashion, whereas pma/cd <dig> stimulation results in a th2-like phenotype independent of the proximal tcr-tyrosine kinase lck.
translation towards a primary, whole blood setting and purified human cd4+ t cells revealed that pma/cd <dig> stimulation induced a more pronounced th <dig> specific, lck and pkcθ dependent ifnγ production, whereas pma/cd <dig> induced th <dig> specific il- <dig> and il- <dig> production, independent of lck activation.
this approach offers a robust and fast translational in vitro system for skewed t helper cell responses in jurkat t cells, primary human cd4+ tcells and in a more complex matrix such as human whole blood.
to identify genes and pathways involved in differentiation of jurkat t cells towards th <dig> and th <dig> subtypes we performed comprehensive transcriptome analyses of jurkat t cells stimulated with various stimuli and pathway inhibitors.
medial signaling via mapkinases appeared to be less important in these pathways, since specific inhibitors of these kinases displayed a minor effect on gene expression.
knock down with sirna and gene expression profiling in the presence of selective kinase inhibitors showed that proximal kinases lck and pkcθ are crucial signaling hubs during t helper cell activation, revealing a clear role for lck in th <dig> development and for pkcθ in both th <dig> and th <dig> development.
this study identifies stimulatory pathways and gene expression profiles for in vitro skewing of t helper cell activation.

naïve t cells may differentiate into th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> or itreg phenotypes, depending on environmental co-stimulatory signals.
calcium-dependent activation of t cells using cd3/cd <dig> and pma/cd <dig> stimulation induced a th <dig> expression profile reflected by increased expression of t-bet, runx <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifnγ, whereas calcium-independent activation via pma/cd <dig> induced a th <dig> expression profile which included gata <dig>  rxra, ccl <dig> and itk.
