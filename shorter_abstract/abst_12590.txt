comparison of dpp sequences from at least one member of each major branch in the mammalian evolutionary tree  as well as one reptile and bird may help delineate its possible functions in both dentin and ductal epithelia.
dentin sialophosphoprotein  is the largest member of the sibling family and is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in dentin.
two toothless anteater species have evolved different sets of nonsense mutations shortly after their bmp <dig> motifs suggesting that while cleavage may be important for dspp processing in other tissues, the dpp domain itself may be required only in dentin.
the dpp domain of dspp was found to change dramatically within mammals and was lost in two truly toothless animals.
while the rgd domain is lost in many species, some evolutionary pressure to maintain integrin binding can be observed.
the number of tandem repeats of the nominal serserasp phosphorylation motif in toothed mammals , ranged from ~ <dig>  to > <dig> .
