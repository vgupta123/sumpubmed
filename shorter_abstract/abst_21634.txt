by quantitative ct, the bone mineral density was higher in the 560 μg with  <dig> and  <dig> cells groups, while non-uniformity of the bone mineral density was improved in the 560 μg with  <dig> and  <dig> cells groups and 140 μg/ <dig> cells group.
implantation of e. coli-derived rhbmp- <dig> and bmscs led to significantly enhanced bone formation, with improved bone mineral density and reduced non-uniformity of the regenerated bone.
implantation of osteoinductive factors can promote bone healing, while transplantation of osteoprogenitor cells can enhance bone regeneration.
we hypothesized that implantation of an osteoinductive factor, recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- <dig> , combined with osteoprogenitor cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells , would synergistically promote bone healing.
critical-sized osteoperiosteal segmental defects  were created in the ulnae of healthy female beagle dogs, and implanted with combinations of e. coli-derived rhbmp- <dig>  and autologous bmscs .
the control groups  were cited from our previous study to reduce the number of experimental animals.

mechanically, the maximum loads at failure were significantly higher in the 560 μg with  <dig> and  <dig> cells groups.
in the present study, <dig> forelimbs of nine healthy purpose-bred female beagles were used.
radiographically, the regenerated bone width was significantly increased in the  <dig> or 140 μg with  <dig> and  <dig> cells groups compared with the  <dig> cells groups.
large bone defects in canines usually require assistance to achieve healing.
