segregating auditory scenes into distinct objects or streams is one of our brain's greatest perceptual challenges.
in addition, within this roi the pattern of acoustic response across voxels is significantly correlated with the pattern of perceptual modulation.
throughout the last decade different methodologies have yielded inconsistent evidence about the role of auditory cortex in the maintenance of streams.
our results show that the maintenance of auditory streams is reflected in ac activity, directly relating sound responses to perception, and that perceptual state is further represented in multiple, higher level cortical regions.
in particular, studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging  have been unable to show persistent activity within auditory cortex  that distinguishes between perceptual states.
we use bistable stimuli, an explicit perceptual categorization task, and a focused region of interest  analysis to demonstrate an effect of perceptual state within ac.
in a whole-brain exploratory test, we corroborate previous work showing an effect of perceptual state in the intraparietal sulcus.
