based on manual curation and sequence comparisons among putative g-protein-coupled chemoreceptor genes in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, we identified approximately  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes in the  <dig> largest gene families, most of which fall into larger superfamilies.
chemoreceptor gene families in caenorhabditis species are large and evolutionarily dynamic as a result of gene duplication and gene loss.
protein trees reveal family-specific and species-specific patterns of gene duplication and gene loss.
to explain these patterns, we propose the gray pawn hypothesis: individual genes are of little significance, but the aggregate of a large number of diverse genes is required to cover a large phenotype space.
in the related species c. briggsae and c. remanei, we identified most or all genes in each of the  <dig> families.
several families include large species-specific expansions, mostly in c. elegans and c. remanei.
these dynamics shape the chemoreceptor gene complements in caenorhabditis species and define the receptor space available for chemosensory responses.
for most families, c. elegans has the largest number of genes and c. briggsae the smallest number, suggesting changes in the importance of chemoperception among the species.
animal genomes contain families of genes encoding chemoreceptors that mediate taste, olfaction, and pheromone responses.
