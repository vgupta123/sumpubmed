although it is not difficult for state-of-the-art gene finders to identify coding regions in prokaryotic genomes, exact prediction of the corresponding translation initiation sites  is still a challenging problem.
despite the generality of the underlying algorithm, the prediction rate of our method is competitive on experimentally verified test data from e. coli and b. subtilis.
on reliable test data we showed that our method provides good results in post-processing the predictions of the widely-used program glimmer.
as compared with other methods for improving predictions of gene starts in bacterial genomes, our approach is not based on any specific assumptions about prokaryotic tis.
the underlying clustering algorithm is robust with respect to variations in the initial tis annotation and does not require specific assumptions about prokaryotic gene starts.
regarding genomes with high g+c content, in contrast to some previously proposed methods, our algorithm also provides good performance on p. aeruginosa, b. pseudomallei and r. solanacearum.
recently a number of post-processing tools have been proposed for improving the annotation of prokaryotic tis.
we introduce a clustering algorithm for completely unsupervised scoring of potential tis, based on positionally smoothed probability matrices.
however, inherent difficulties of these approaches arise from the considerable variation of tis characteristics across different species.
the algorithm has been implemented in the tool »tico« which is publicly available from our web site.
these features are particularly useful on genomes with high g+c content.
