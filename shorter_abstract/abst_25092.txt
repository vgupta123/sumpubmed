however, molecular age estimates for lepidosauria have been problematic; dates for the most recent common ancestor of all lepidosaurs range between approximately  <dig> and  <dig> mya whereas estimates for crown-group squamata  vary more dramatically:  <dig> to  <dig> mya.
using rag <dig> sequence data from  <dig> extant taxa and the new fossil specimens two of several calibrations, we estimate that the most recent common ancestor of lepidosauria lived at least  <dig> mya , and crown-group squamata originated around  <dig> mya .
our origin time for crown-group squamata coincides with shifts towards warmer climates and dramatic changes in fauna and flora.
the earliest fossil records are currently restricted to the late triassic and often dated to  <dig> million years ago .
the vellberg fossil locality is expected to become an important resource for providing a more balanced picture of the triassic and for bridging gaps in the fossil record of several other major vertebrate groups.
here we report on a rhynchocephalian fossil from the middle triassic of germany  that represents the oldest known record of a lepidosaur from anywhere in the world.
a early/middle triassic date for the origin of lepidosauria disagrees with previous estimates deep within the permian and suggests the group evolved as part of the faunal recovery after the end-permain mass extinction as the climate became more humid.
as these early records include taxa that are relatively derived in their morphology , an earlier unknown history of lepidosauria is implied.
