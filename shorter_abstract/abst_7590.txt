although myst <dig> mrna transcripts are ubiquitous, protein expression was restricted to select extracts .
immunohistochemistry experiments performed on ovary sections revealed that the myst <dig> protein is confined to oocytes, granulosa and theca cells, as well as to cells composing the blood vessels.
because the majority of these cells are involved in male and female gametogenesis, myst <dig> may contribute to important and specific acetylation events occurring during gametes and embryo development.
within testis sections, the myst <dig> protein was specific to only one cell type, the elongating spermatids, where it was exclusively nuclear.
