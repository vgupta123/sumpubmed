the regenerating fragment is able to create new tissues and remodel existing tissues to form a complete animal.
by comparing differentially expressed transcripts at various time-points, we revealed that this divergence/convergence pattern is caused by a shared regulatory program that runs early in heads and later in tails.
we find the gene regulation program in response to smed-prep to display the opposite regulatory trend compared to the previously mentioned share regulatory program during regeneration.
furthermore, our consolidated transcriptome and annotations allowed us to identity triclad specific transcripts that are enriched within this core regulatory program.
planarians can regenerate entire animals from a small fragment of the body.
in this study, we performed an extensive rna-seq time-course on regenerating head and tail fragments to observe the differences and similarities of the transcriptional landscape between head and tail fragments during regeneration.
we performed a rna-seq time-course on regenerating head and tail fragments from  <dig> hours to  <dig> days.
we found that the transcriptome profiles of head and tail regeneration were very different at the start of regeneration; however, an unexpected convergence of transcriptional profiles occurred at  <dig> hours when head and tail fragments are still morphologically distinct.
additionally, we also performed rna-seq on smed-prep tail fragments which ultimately fail to regenerate anterior structures.
we have consolidated existing transcriptomic data for s. mediterranea to generate a high confidence set of transcripts for use in genome wide expression studies.
the regeneration transcriptome of head and tail regeneration provides us with a rich resource for investigating the global expression changes that occurs during regeneration.
we show that very different regenerative scenarios utilize a shared core regenerative program.
using annotation data and comparative approaches, we also identified a set of approximately  <dig>  triclad specific transcripts that were enriched amongst the genes displaying differential expression during the regeneration time-course.
