ontology curation aims to produce a faithful representation of knowledge domains as they keep developing, which requires the translation of general guidelines into specific representations of reality and an understanding of how scientific knowledge is produced and constantly updated.
this paper illustrates how these processes are carried out, by studying the ways in which curators at the gene ontology have hitherto incorporated new knowledge into their resource.
this study illustrates the difficulties involved in applying general standards to the development of a specific ontology.
in this context, it is important that trained curators with technical expertise in the scientific field in question are involved in supervising ontology shifts and identifying inaccuracies.
