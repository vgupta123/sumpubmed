there was no significant difference between the left and right jf within each group.
this study investigates an unconventional pathogenetic theory for the development of cerebrospinal fluid  pressure waves in the subarachnoid space in ckcs with sm, by analogy with human diseases.
a stenosis of the jf and a consequential vascular compromise in this opening could contribute to venous hypertension, raising icp and causing csf jets in the spinal subarachnoid space of the ckcs.
a stenosis of the jf and consecutive venous congestion may explain the aetiology of csf pressure waves in the subarachnoid space, independent of cerebellar herniation, as an additional pathogenetic factor for the development of sm in this breed.
in children with achondroplasia the shortening of the skull base can lead to a narrowing of the jugular foramina  between the cranial base synchondroses.
bland-altman analysis revealed excellent reproducibility of all volume measurements.
in this study, jf volumes in ckcss with and without sm were compared to assess a possible role of this pathologic mechanism in the development of sm in this breed.
this in turn has been reported to cause a congestion of the major venous outflow tracts of the skull and consequently to an increase in the intracranial pressure .
understanding the pathogenesis of the chiari-like malformation in the cavalier king charles spaniel  is incomplete, and current hypotheses do not fully explain the development of syringomyelia  in the spinal cords of affected dogs.
