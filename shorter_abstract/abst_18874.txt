here there is no cooperative dilemma as individuals cannot avoid producing information for their neighbors.
grouping evolves because it allows individuals to better sense and deplete patches.
such enhanced patch depletion is particularly apparent on fragmented and partially depleted patches, which are especially difficult for solitary foragers to deplete.
we therefore use a spatial individual-based model where food patches are aggregates of food items beyond the scale of individual perception.
solitary foragers often leave a patch prematurely because a whole patch cannot be observed directly.
our results show that grouping can evolve to increase food intake rates.
thus we reveal how such a synergy can originate in evolution as a side-effect of grouping via multi-level selection.
these models assume discrete food patches which are fully detectable.
grouping therefore leads to a release from individual sensing constraints and a shift in niche specialization, allowing individuals to better exploit partially depleted patches.
