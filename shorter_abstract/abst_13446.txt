positional correlation between + and - strand chip-seq tags revealed that, in contrast to other transcription factors, nfi associates with a nucleosomal length of cleavage-resistant dna, suggesting an interaction with positioned nucleosomes.
the nuclear factor i  family of dna binding proteins  is involved in both dna replication and gene expression regulation.
our data thus suggest that nfi nucleosomal interaction may contribute to the partitioning of distinct chromatin domains and to epigenetic gene expression regulation.
in addition, nfi binding prominently occurred at boundaries displaying discontinuities in histone modifications specific of expressed and silent chromatin, such as loci submitted to parental allele-specific imprinted expression.
genomic binding also correlated with markers of transcribed genes such as histone modifications h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  even outside of annotated transcribed loci, implying nfi in the control of the deposition of these modifications.
using chromatin immuno-precipitation and high throughput sequencing , we performed a genome-wide mapping of nfi dna binding sites in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
