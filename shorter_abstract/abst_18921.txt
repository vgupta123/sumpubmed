more than  <dig>  rad clusters with more than  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> insertions/deletions were detected and characterized.
about one third of the rad clusters and polymorphisms mapped to the brassica rapa reference sequence.
an even distribution of rad clusters and polymorphisms was observed across the b. rapa chromosomes, which suggests that there might be an equal distribution over the brassica oleracea chromosomes, too.
the representation of gene ontology  terms for unigenes with rad clusters and polymorphisms revealed no signature of selection with respect to the distribution of polymorphisms within genes belonging to a specific go category.
considering the decreasing costs for next-generation sequencing, the results of our study suggest that rad sequencing is not only a simple and cost-effective method for high-density polymorphism detection but also an alternative to snp genotyping from transcriptome sequencing or snp arrays, even for species with complex genomes such as b. napus.
we used a diversity set of b. napus representing eight different germplasm types to sequence genome-wide distributed restriction-site associated dna  fragments for polymorphism detection and genotyping.
good knowledge of sequence variation is needed for genetics approaches and breeding purposes.
