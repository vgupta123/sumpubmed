we found no significant difference in the strength of adhesions, but did find that adult axons were  <dig> times intrinsically stiffer than neonatal axons.
to investigate we first measured the rate of axonal elongation of sensory neurons cultured from neonatal and adult rats.
we found that neonatal axons grew 40% faster than adult axons .
taken together, our results suggest decreasing axonal stiffness may be part of an effective strategy to accelerate the regeneration of axons in the adult peripheral nervous system.
at the biophysical level, why this occurs is not well understood.
as we age, the speed of axonal regeneration declines.
to determine how the mechanical properties of axons change during maturation, we used force calibrated towing needles to measure the viscosity  and strength of substrate adhesion of neonatal and adult sensory axons.
