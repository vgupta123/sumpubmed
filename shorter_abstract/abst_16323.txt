these results give support for the use of updated probe set definitions for analysis and meta-analysis of microarray data.
microarrays enable high throughput detection of transcript expression levels.
updated probe set definitions does not only offer expression levels that are more accurately associated to genes and transcripts but also improvements in the estimated transcript expression levels.
different investigators have recently introduced updated probe set definitions to more accurately map probes to our current knowledge of genes and transcripts.
