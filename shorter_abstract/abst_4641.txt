in addition, three expressed haplotypes were observed for six predicted single-copy genes in  <dig> sequencing analysis and results from flow cytometry indicate that the dna content of c. sativa is approximately three-fold that of diploid camelina relatives.
there is compelling evidence for triplication of the c. sativa genome, including a larger chromosome number and three-fold larger measured genome size than other camelina relatives, three isolated copies of fad <dig>  fae <dig>  and the kcs17-fae <dig> intergenic region, and three expressed haplotypes observed for six predicted single-copy genes.
based on these results, we propose that c. sativa be considered an allohexaploid.
phylogenetic analyses further support a history of duplication and indicate that c. sativa and c. microcarpa might share a parental genome.
in c. sativa, southern analysis indicates the presence of three copies of both fad <dig> and fae <dig> as well as lfy, a known single copy gene in other species.
camelina sativa, an oilseed crop in the brassicaceae family, has inspired renewed interest due to its potential for biofuels applications.
the characterization of fatty acid synthesis pathway genes will allow for the future manipulation of oil composition of this emerging biofuel crop; however, targeted manipulations of oil composition and general development of c. sativa should consider and, when possible take advantage of, the implications of polyploidy.
a study was undertaken to characterize two genes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, fatty acid desaturase   <dig> and fatty acid elongase   <dig>  which revealed unexpected complexity in the c. sativa genome.
little is understood of the nature of the c. sativa genome, however.
the regions downstream of csfad <dig> and upstream of csfae <dig> demonstrate co-linearity with the arabidopsis genome.
