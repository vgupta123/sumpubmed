this suggests that gene replacement somehow occurred by recombination at the very ends of rpl <dig>  without the level and length of similarity normally expected to support recombination.
moreover, the transferred gene has physically replaced the native rpl <dig> gene, yet flanking genes and intergenic regions show no sign of hgt.
in this study, we analyzed all genes from sequenced plastid genomes to unearth any neglected cases of hgt and to obtain a measure of the overall extent of hgt to the plastid.
most of the conflicts involved near neighbors connected by long branches , where phylogenetic methods are prone to mislead.
further taxon sampling of clpp and ycf <dig> resulted in rejection of hgt due to long-branch attraction and a serious error in the published plastid genome sequence of oenothera elata, respectively.
the plastid acquisition of a bacterial rpl <dig> gene via hgt provides the first strong evidence for a sister-group relationship between haptophyte and cryptophyte plastids to the exclusion of heterokont and alveolate plastids.
horizontal gene transfer  to the plant mitochondrial genome has recently been shown to occur at a surprisingly high rate; however, little evidence has been found for hgt to the plastid genome, despite extensive sequencing.
however, three genes – clpp, ycf <dig>  and rpl <dig> – provided strong support for taxa moving far from their organismal position.
although several genes gave strongly supported conflicting trees under certain conditions, we are confident of hgt in only a single case beyond the rubisco hgt already reported.
a single new case, a bacterial rpl <dig> gene transferred into the ancestor of the cryptophyte and haptophyte plastids, appears to be a true hgt event.
